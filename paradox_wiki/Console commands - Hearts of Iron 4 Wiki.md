This page lists the codes which may be input into the Console Window, a special debugging window which may be accessed on non-ironman games by hitting `^` , `°` or tilde (~) (key varies based on keyboard layout). Press the up or down arrow keys to traverse through previously executed commands. Many codes can be turned off by repeating the command, but sometimes reloading the save or exiting the game is necessary. Please note that many of these commands come in and out with each DLC making some of them not work. Mods may introduce commands and more commonly, tags into the game to enhance their gameplay.

Also of note, commands may not work in ironman games by design.

## List of commands

Press Shift+2, §, ~, \, `, ", ^ or ALT+2+1, or Shift+3 to access the console (key varies based on keyboard layout)

### Internal IDs

*See also: Countries*

Console commands use internal IDs, which may be obtained in a variety of different ways.

An easy way to tell internal IDs is debug mode. `debug` as a console command will turn on debug mode which can provide information about certain database entries, such as focuses, national spirits (and other ideas such as laws or designers), or technologies when hovering over them, as well as obtaining information when hovering over a province of IDs of the state and the province, as well as the 3-letter country tag of the country it belongs to. [Note that while modding, the console command does not do everything that the launch option does and cannot serve as a substitute.](<Modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#advantages-to-using-debug>)

If that is impossible, using localisation is an alternative. To do that, navigate to the folder where the game is contained, then to the /Hearts of Iron IV/localisation/english/ folder. Each file in there contains localisation keys with values that actually appear in-game assigned to them. Using a non-default text editor can also allow using the 'Search in files' function (Such as in Notepad++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code) in order to search through every single localisation file at the same time to find a specified value.

### Disambiguation

In this article, there are 3 types of brackets used within commands:

- Regular brackets as in `instantconstruction(ic)` are used to show aliases, alternate names for the console commands. In this case, using `ic` or `instantconstruction` has the same effect in-game.
- Square brackets as in `fow [Province ID]` signify an *optional* argument. In this case, both `fow` and `fow 1234` will work, but may have different effects.
- Square brackets in combination with angle brackets as in `event [<event ID>]` signify a *mandatory* argument. In this case, `event generic.1` will work, but `event` will not.

### Glossary

MIOs is an acronym for Military Industrial Organizations
