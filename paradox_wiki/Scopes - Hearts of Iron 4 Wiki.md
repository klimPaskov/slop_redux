**Scopes** change the currently-selected entity where the effects should apply or which is checked by the [triggers](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>). Each one must follow the same formatting of `scope = { <contents> }`.

When a scope is used as for effects, each effect inside of the scope's block is executed. Conversely, when a scope is used as for triggers, it serves as a [logical conjunction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction), requiring every trigger in the scope's block to be met for that scope to evaluate as true.

In addition to serving as blocks for effects or triggers, some scopes can also serve as targets of effects or triggers: e.g. `transfer_state_to = ROOT` or `owns_state = 123`.
 However, only [some dual scopes](#dual-scopes) can be used as a target. For scopes that cannot be used as targets, [PREV](#prev-usage), Variables, or Event targets can be used to get around this limitation.

## Types

Scopes can be thought of as divided into 3 types by purpose:

- Trigger scopes - those that can only be used in trigger blocks, failing when put within an effect block.
- Effect scopes - those that can only be used in effect blocks, failing when put within an trigger block.
- Dual scopes - those that can be put in both trigger and effect blocks without issues.

It is to be noted that trigger or effect scopes cannot ever be used as targets. That is strictly limited to [some dual scopes](#dual-scopes).

Most of the non-dual scopes follow one of these following patterns:

- **all_<object>**
  - Description: Trigger scope, evaluated for each contained scope. Returns false when encountering at least one scope that is false, returns true otherwise.

- **any_<object>**
  - Description:
    ```text
    Trigger scope, evaluated for each contained scope. Returns true when encountering at least one scope that is true, returns false otherwise.
    It have optional
    count = <int>/<variable>
    functionality which will evaluate true if at least "count" items fulfill the child triggers.
    ```

- **every_<object>**
  - Description:
    ```text
    Effect scope, executes the effects on each contained scope
    that meets the limit
    in order.
    ```

- **random_<object>**
  - Description:
    ```text
    Effect scope, executes the effects on a random contained scope
    that meets the limit
    .
    ```

Only some scopes that follow this pattern have equivalents with a different pattern. For example, `random_owned_controlled_state` exists, but `every_owned_controlled_state` does not. **Each of these non-dual scopes cannot select a country that does not exist**, with the exception of [every\_possible\_country](#every-possible-country).

Additionally, scopes can be divided into 6 types by the targets of the scope for which effects are executed or triggers are checked:

- Country scopes - Executed for countries.
- State scopes - Executed for states.
- Character scopes - Executed for characters. Some subsets exist, such as unit leaders and country leaders.
- Division scopes - Executed for divisions.
- MIO scopes - Executed for military industrial organisations.
- Contract scopes - Executed for purchase contracts.
- Special Project scopes - Executed for special projects.

Only effects or [triggers](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) of the same target type can be used. For example, `add_building_construction` can only be used in a state scope such as `random_owned_controlled_state = { ... }`, as you can only construct buildings in states. For countries, [offsite buildings are used instead](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#add-offsite-building>).

## Examples

Example scope with effects: all contained effects are executed for the scope. This adds 10% ![Stability](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img1.png)Stability and 20% ![War support](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img2.png)War support to the ![Flag of Soviet Union](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img3.png) Soviet Union:

```text
SOV = {
    add_stability = 0.1
    add_war_support = 0.2
}
```

Example scope with triggers: all contained triggers must return true for the scope; otherwise, the scope returns false. This requires the state 123 (South-West England) to be owned by the ![Flag of United Kingdom](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img4.png) United Kingdom and controlled by ![Flag of Ireland](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img5.png) Ireland:

```text
123 = {
    is_owned_by = ENG
    is_controlled_by = IRE
}
```

Example use of PREV as target for non-targetable scope. Since `random_country` cannot be used as a target, `add_to_faction = random_country` is not valid syntax; instead, [PREV](#prev-usage) can be used to get around this limitation. The following example adds random country to ROOT's faction:

```text
random_country = {
    ROOT = { add_to_faction = PREV }
}
```

## Settings

Scopes can have additional settings to narrow down the usage. This may change how many and which targets it's able to select or what the tooltip shows.

### Limiting

Non-dual scopes that select unit leaders or MIOs, such as `every_navy_leader`, by default only include those that are visible to the player, i.e. those unit leaders whose roles do not have an unfulfilled `visible = { ... }` and those MIOs that do not have an unfulfilled `visible = { ... }`. By including `include_invisible = yes`, this can be changed. This will look as such:

```text
random_army_leader = {
    include_invisible = yes
    set_nationality = SWE
}
```

Within **only** effect scopes, `limit = { ... }` can be used as a trigger block, evaluated for each possible target contained by the scope. In case of the `every_<name>` pattern, this will ensure that the tooltip will function properly, which may not be the case when using `if` directly. In case of the `random_<name>` pattern, this will remove the possibility of scopes not meeting the triggers being chosen, limiting the selection. For `party_leader` in specific, the limit must contain [has\_ideology](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#has-ideology>), while there are no requirements on other scopes. An example of limiting the selection is the following:

```text
every_neighbor_country = { #Targets every neighbor country
    limit = {
        num_of_military_factories > 5 #Limit the scope to neighbor countries with more than 5 (at least 6) military factories
    }
    give_military_access = ROOT #Neighbor countries with more than 5 military factories give military access to the ROOT country
}
```

In case of multiple triggers, `limit` acts like an `AND` block, requiring each one to be true. To reiterate, **this cannot be used within trigger or dual scopes**, only in effect scopes.

For scopes of the `every_` type, an additional setting for limiting the selection is `random_select_amount`. In particular, it takes an integer and limits the maximum amount of chosen scopes to that number, picking a random sub-set if exceeded. It is used as such:

```text
every_country = {
    random_select_amount = 3 # Selects 3 random countries
    country_event = lottery_win.0
}
```

### Tooltip

By default, using a scope of either of the `any_`, `all_`, and `every_` types will show a title specific to that scope in the tooltip, such as `Every country:` or `All neighbor states:`. If scope limits are used, then this changes to the list of scopes that fulfill the limit, such as `Corsica, Rome, Sardinia:`. For countries, the order in which [country tags are created](<Country creation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#country-tags>) is used in ordering; for states, the state ID is used. If the tooltip differs depending on the scope where it's executed, such as with if statements, then only the first-selected scope is used in the evaluation.

By using `tooltip = loc_key` within any non-dual scope, including of the `random_` type, the tooltip shown to the player can be changed towards the value of the targeted [localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) key in the currently enabled language. This will look like the following:

```text
any_country = {
    hidden_trigger = {
        has_opinion = { target = PREV value > 50 } # Serves as a "limit" hidden from the player.
    }
    tooltip = any_friendly_country_tt # Replaces "Any country" with the localisation key
    has_war_with = ITA
}
```

The localisation key will be defined as such in any localisation file:

```text
l_english:
any_friendly_country_tt: "Any friendly country"
```

This will appear in the tooltip as such:

In tooltips of the `every_` type where scope limits are used, by default the tooltip unites it into a single scope, such as `Germany, United Kingdom, Soviet Union:`. By using `display_individual_scopes = yes`, this will make each selected scope appear in the tooltip separately. For example:

```text
every_neighbor_country = {
    limit = {
        OR = { has_government = communism has_government = fascism }
    }
    display_individual_scopes = yes
    if = {
        limit = {
            has_government = fascism
        }
        add_war_support = -0.1
    }
    else = { add_stability = -0.1 }
}
```

Without displaying individual scopes, this will be shown as one effect block, such as the following:

By the nature of tooltips, the if statements for the first country are evaluated and the same tooltip is shown for both countries. This falsely implies that the Soviet Union will have 10% ![War support](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img11.png)War support removed. However, adding `display_individual_scopes = yes` changes it to the following:

### Priority

Within effect scopes of the `random_` type, if it is aimed at states, it is possible to prioritize a certain state if possible, by using `prioritize` as such:

```text
random_owned_controlled_state = {
    prioritize = { 123 321 }
    limit = {
        is_core_of = PREV
    }
    <...>
}
```

In this case, the limit will first be evaluated for states 123 and 321. Only if neither of the states 123 or 321 meets the conditions of being owned, controlled, and cored by the country will the random\_owned\_controlled\_state scope be able to select a state that isn't 123 or 321. States 123 and 321, in this case, have the same priority: if both have conditions fulfilled, which one will be picked is random. This only applies at scopes of the `random_` type which target states, this cannot be done with countries or characters.

## Dual scopes

The following scopes can be used either as effect or trigger scopes; some can also be used as the right side of some effects and triggers as a target. If usage as a target is possible, it's marked within the table.

Several dual scopes may have a scope that varies depending on where it's used, such as variables, which can be set to anything.

- **TAG**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Target type: Country scope
  - Example: SOV = { country_event = my_event.1 }
  - Description:
    ```text
    The country defined by the tag or tag alias. Tag aliases are defined in
    /Hearts of Iron IV/common/country_tag_aliases
    , as a way to refer to a specific country (such as a side in a civil war) in addition to its actual tag. If the country with the exact tag doesn't exist, but a dynamic country originating from the specified tag does, the scope will refer to the dynamic country.

            }
        }
    } #GER declares war on ENG (if there is no scope before ENG)
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Targets the root node of the block, an inherent property of each block. Most commonly, this is the default scope: for example, ROOT
    within a national focus
    will always refer to the country doing the focus and ROOT
    within a event
    will always refer to the country getting the event. However, some blocks do distinguish between the default scope and ROOT, such as
    certain scripted GUI contexts
    or
    certain on actions
    . If a block doesn't have ROOT defined (such as
    on_startup in on actions
    ), then it is impossible to use it.

    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Can be chained indefinitely as FROM.FROM. Used to target various hardcoded scopes inherent to the block, often a secondary scope in addition to ROOT. For example:
    In
    events
    , this refers to the country that sent the event (i.e. if the event was fired
    using an effect
    , then it's the ROOT scope where it was fired).
    In

### Invalid event target

*See also: Event targets*

In regards to some dual scopes, a possible logged error to get while using them is "Invalid event target", as in `common/national_focus/generic.txt:690: controller: invalid event target: controller`, while the scope being used is not necessarily an event target.
This refers to the scope not having any defined target in the context that it is used, i.e. it is impossible to select any single target when it is used. In case of `controller = { ... }` as in the example, this means that the scope is checked or executed in a state that isn't controlled by any country. Such states are rather unstable and can cause crashes easily (such as if evaluated for an air mission by AI or if doing almost any effect on them), so if this happens for `controller` or `owner`, then this must be fixed only by making sure that every state has an owner or controller.

In practice, this gets skipped over entirely when evaluating the effects or triggers: none of the effects would be executed; as a trigger it'll not come up as either true or false. However, since this can be checked every tick, leaving it as is can result in cluttering the error log. To avoid this, it's possible to use the if statement in [effects](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#if-statements>) or [triggers](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#if>) in such a manner that the dual scope would only be checked if the conditions for it existing are fulfilled, such as by checking that the country is indeed a subject before checking the overlord. An example of that being done is as such:

```text
if = {
    limit = {
        is_subject = yes
    }
    overlord = {
        country_event = example.0
    }
}
```

While this has identical effects regardless of whether the country is independent or is a subject, this doesn't access the `overlord` scope for an independent country.

## Trigger scopes

    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    The
    reserve_dynamic_country
    effect can be used if the dynamic country does not yet exist in order to ensure that it does not get overwritten by other creations of dynamic countries.
    ```

## Array scopes

*See also: Arrays*

Arrays can be used to create a generic selection of scopes meeting the criteria. These scopes exist for checking conditions on elements of an array or executing effects on them:

- **any_of_scopes**
  - Type: Trigger
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    array = <array>
    The array to check.
    tooltip = <localisation key>
    The localisation key used for the trigger.
    <triggers>
    An AND trigger block.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    any_of_scopes = {
        array = global.majors
        tooltip = has_more_states_than_any_other_major_tt
        NOT = { tag = PREV }
        check_variable = { num_owned_controlled_states > PREV.num_owned_controlled_states }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Checks if any value within the array fulfills the triggers, halting and returning true if that's the case, scoping into each element in the array.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Appending
    _NOT
    to the tooltip's key (such as has_more_states_than_any_other_major_tt_NOT in the example) results in the localisation key used if this any_of_scopes is put inside of
    NOT = { ... }
    .
    ```

- **all_of_scopes**
  - Type: Trigger
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    array = <array>
    The array to check.
    tooltip = <localisation key>
    The localisation key used for the trigger.
    <triggers>
    An AND trigger block.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    all_of_scopes = {
        array = global.majors
        tooltip = has_more_states_than_every_other_major_tt
        OR = {
            tag = PREV
            check_variable = { num_owned_controlled_states < PREV.num_owned_controlled_states }
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Checks if every value within the array fulfills the triggers, halting and returning false if any one doesn't, scoping into each element in the array.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Appending
    _NOT
    to the tooltip's key (such as has_more_states_than_every_other_major_tt_NOT in the example) results in the localisation key used if this any_of_scopes is put inside of
    NOT = { ... }
    .
    ```

- **for_each_scope_loop**
  - Type: Effect
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    array = <array>
    The array to check.
    break = <variable>
    The temporary variable that can be set to be not 0 to instantly break the loop.
    <effects>
    An effect block.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    for_each_scope_loop = {
        array = global.majors
        if = {
            limit = {

            }
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Runs the effects for every scope within the array.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Equivalent to a
    every_<...>
    effect scope type, with additional
    break
    .
    ```

- **random_scope_in_array**
  - Type: Effect
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    array = <array>
    The array to check.
    break = <variable>
    The temporary variable that can be set to be not 0 to instantly break the loop.
    limit = { <triggers> }
    An AND trigger block deciding which scopes can be picked.
    <effects>
    An effect block.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    random_scope_in_array = {
        array = global.countries
        break = break
        limit = {

            exists = no
            any_state = {
                is_core_of = PREV   # Is core of the currently-checked country
            }
        }
        random_core_state = {
            transfer_state_to = PREV    # Transfers to the currently-selected country.
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Runs the effects for a random scope within the array.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Equivalent to a
    random_<...>
    effect scope type, with additional
    break
    .
    ```

## PREV usage

In order to understand PREV, it can be helpful to think back to the trigger/effect scopes such as every\_controlled\_state. In this case, if put inside directly, PREV can be used as the controller of the state. In fact, every\_controlled\_state is equivalent to every\_state with a limit of `is_controlled_by = PREV` in most ways, although it is recommended to use every\_controlled\_state instead as it is better for optimisation. For example, the following will transfer every state to its controller, changing the owner:

```text
every_country = {
    every_controlled_state = {
        transfer_state_to = PREV
    }
}
```

If thinking of it as a tree, the scopes are in the order of [every\_country,every\_controlled\_state]. Using it within every\_controlled\_state will refer back to the parent node, or every\_country, specifically the country in the every\_country list this is currently being executed for. This can be used in other ways, such as obtaining a wargoal against the owner of a state:

```text
123 = {
    owner = {
        ROOT = {
            create_wargoal = {
                target = PREV
                type = take_state_focus
                generator = { 123 }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

![A diagram showing the connection in the code.](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img15.png)

Diagram showing how PREV and PREV.PREV connect to other entries in the code example.

In this case, the tree is constructed with [123,owner,ROOT]. Using PREV within ROOT will refer to the previously-defined owner.

Chaining PREV can be done by separating them with a dot as PREV.PREV.PREV. This can be useful if the needed scope is more than 1 scope back.
This is an another example of PREV usage with an attached diagram showing how they connect to other scopes:

```text
every_country = {
    limit = {
        any_country = {
            any_country = {
                has_war_with = PREV
                is_neighbor_of = PREV.PREV
            }
            has_attache_from = PREV
        }
    }
    country_event = my_event.0
}
```

In this case, an event will be sent to every country that has sent an attaché to a country that's at war with a neighbour of the original country (i.e. the country that would receive the event). Using PREV.PREV is necessary in this case as all 3 countries don't have single defined tags or pointers and all interact with each other.

In many cases, using PREV can result in seemingly broken tooltips which'll work fine regardless when executing the effects in-game. This typically happens when using it pointing to scopes of the `every_<...>`/`all_<...>` types. A single effect or trigger's tooltip can only show one scope as a target at once, and the game would only pick the first possible scope in the tooltip. This can look like the following:

- (Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily):
  - ![Flag of Switzerland](media/scopes-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_eff9c6f993__img16.png) Switzerland:
    - Becomes owner and controller of **Sardinia**

This can not be avoided with traditional means while still using PREV. Instead, it's possible to use [hidden\_effect and custom\_effect\_tooltip](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#effect-tooltips>) or [custom\_trigger\_tooltip](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#custom-trigger-tooltip>) in order to completely replace the tooltip in this case.

## Flow control tools

While these aren't scopes, not changing where the effects are run or triggers are checked, they still function as blocks of code that can be used within any trigger and/or effect.

- **AND**
  - Usage: Within triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    AND = {
        original_tag = GER
        has_stability > 0.5
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Returns false if any sub-trigger returns false, true otherwise. Evaluation stops at the first false sub-trigger.
    Nearly all trigger blocks (including scopes) use AND by defaults, so its primary use is with OR and NOT, which affects their function.
    ```
  - Notes: Usually modifies trigger tooltips to include "All of the following must be true"

- **OR**
  - Usage: Within triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    OR = {
        original_tag = ENG
        original_tag = USA
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Returns true if any sub-trigger returns true, false otherwise. Evaluation stops at the first true sub-trigger.
    By default, OR checks each contained trigger separately, AND can be used in order to check between groups of triggers.
    ```
  - Notes: Usually modifies trigger tooltips to include "One of the following must be true"

- **NOT**
  - Usage: Within triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    NOT = {
        has_stability > 0.5
        has_war_support > 0.5
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Returns false if any sub-trigger returns true, true otherwise. Evaluation stops at the first true sub-trigger.
    This is equivalent to logical NOR, as it returns true only if all contained triggers are false.
    There is no direct form of logical NAND (true if any contained trigger is false), however
    NOT = { AND = { … } }
    emulates NAND, as does
    OR = { NOT = { … } NOT = { … } }
    , with each contained trigger in a separate NOT block.
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    NOT also allows emulating greater/less than or equals in comparisions that are normally strictly greater or less than.
    NOT usually inverts trigger tooltips, though not always predictably or neatly. The inverted tooltip for scopes or
    custom_trigger_tooltip
    can be defined by appending
    _NOT
    to the localisation key of the tooltip.
    ```

- **count_triggers**
  - Usage: Within triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    count_triggers = {
        amount = 2
        10 = { state_population_k > 100 }
        11 = { state_population_k > 100 }
        12 = { state_population_k > 100 }
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Returns true if the number of contained triggers which return true is greater than or equal to the value of
    amount
    ```

- **hidden_trigger**
  - Usage: Within triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    hidden_trigger = {
        country_exists = GER
    }
    ```
  - Description: Hides the tooltips from all contained triggers

- **custom_trigger_tooltip**
  - Usage: Within triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    custom_trigger_tooltip = {
        tooltip = sunrise_invasion_tt
        any_state = {
            is_owned_by = JAP
            is_on_continent = europe
            is_coastal = yes
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Replaces the tooltips from all contained triggers with the custom localisation set by
    tooltip
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    If the
    custom_trigger_tooltip
    is negated (within NOT or a
    <scripted_trigger> = no
    , the negated tooltip can be customized by appending
    _NOT
    to the localisation key of the tooltip (e.g.
    sunrise_invasion_tt_NOT
    ).
    ```

- **custom_override_tooltip**
  - Usage: Within effects and triggers
  - Example:
    ```text
    custom_override_tooltip = {
        tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP
        not_tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP_NOT
        <triggers/effects>
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    An
    AND
    trigger/effect that has an overriden custom tooltip.
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    A positive tooltip can be set with
    tooltip
    and the tooltip to be used inside a
    NOT
    can be set with
    not_tooltip
    . If no positive tooltip is provided and the root key is a localization key (not a formatter, see formatted localization), then a negative tooltip will be generated by appending
    _NOT
    to the root localization for the positive tooltip. Both
    tooltip
    and
    not_tooltip
    are bindable localizations.
    ```

- **hidden_effect**
  - Usage: Within effects
  - Example:
    ```text
    hidden_effect = {
        declare_war_on = {
            target = PREV
            type = annex_everything
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Hides the tooltips from all contained effects
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Commonly used alongside
    custom_effect_tooltip
    , to avoid messy effect tooltips or hide precise effects from the player.
    ```

- **effect_tooltip**
  - Usage: Within effects
  - Example:
    ```text
    effect_tooltip = {
        declare_war_on = {
            target = FROM
            type = annex_everything
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Shows the tooltips of the contained effects, but does not execute them.
  - Notes: Most often useful with event chains, where the actual effect is done in a follow-up event.

- **if**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Example:
    ```text
    if = {
        limit = {
            original_tag = GER
        }
        has_political_power > 100
    }
    else_if = {
        limit = {
            original_tag = ENG
        }
        has_stability > 0.5
    }
    else = {
        has_war_support > 0.5
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    If statements allow to conditionally check triggers or run effects. The
    limit
    block is used to define triggers that must be fulfilled for the effects to be run or triggers to be checked. The triggers in
    limit
    are
    never
    shown to the player: if they are unfulfilled, the if statement will have no tooltip, while, if fulfilled, the player will see the effects/triggers inside the if statement itself.
    In addition,
    else_if
    and
    else
    can be optionally defined to run if the limit is considered false. They can be defined as both nested (i.e. directly inside of the previous
    if
    or
    else_if
    ) or unnested (i.e. directly after, but not inside of the previous
    if
    or
    else_if
    ). In case of overlap, the game will prefer the unnested variant, so using that is preferred.
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    else_if
    is optional and can be used as many times as desired.
    else
    is also optional, but can only be used once per
    if
    .
    The main
    if
    as well as any
    else_if
    must have a
    limit
    , and
    else
    cannot use a
    limit
    .
    If statements can be used to clean up tooltips on triggers: the limit can check if the country has a specific tag, while the if statement can contain an always false custom trigger tooltip. This will restrict it from being true for that country, while other countries will not see anything in the tooltip.
    ```

- **for_loop_effect**
  - Usage: Within effects
  - Example:
    ```text
    for_loop_effect = {
        start = -3
        end = 9
        compare = less_than_or_equals
        add = 3
        value = value_name
        break = break_name
        add_political_power = value_name    # Adds -3, then 0, then 3, then 6, then 9, after which the loop breaks for 15 total political power.
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Runs the effect in a typical
    for loop
    , with the current value of the variable kept with the
    temp variable
    specified with
    value
    .
    break
    defines a
    temp variable
    that can be set to 1 to break the loop instantly.
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    If unspecified,
    start
    and
    end
    are 0,
    compare
    is less_than,
    add
    is 1,
    value
    is v, and
    break
    is break. Can run for up to
    1000 times
    before stopping automatically.

- **while_loop_effect**
  - Usage: Within effects
  - Example:
    ```text
    while_loop_effect = {
        break = temp_break
        limit = {
            country_exists = GER
        }
        random_state = {
            limit = {
                is_owned_by = GER
            }
            random_country = {
                limit = {
                    NOT = { tag = GER }
                }
                transfer_state = PREV
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Runs the effect as long as the trigger is true.
    break
    defines a
    temp variable
    that can be set to 1 to break the loop instantly.
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    The trigger is checked at the start of each loop only. Can run for up to
    1000 times
    before stopping automatically. If
    break
    is unspecified, assumes to be a temp variable with the name of break.
    ```

- **random**
  - Usage: Within effects
  - Example:
    ```text
    random = {
        chance = 80
        add_stability = 0.8
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Simulates a random chance to either execute the effect or do nothing, with the
    chance
    used to define the chance.
    ```
  - Notes: Chance is defined on the scale from 0 to 100.

- **random_list**
  - Usage: Within effects
  - Example:
    ```text
    random_list = {
        10 = {
            modifier = {
                factor = 0
                has_stability > 0.9
            }
            add_stability = 0.1
        }
        20 = {
            add_stability = -0.1
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Simulates a random chance to pick one of the listed effects.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Chance for each section is proportional, doesn't have to add up to 100. Can use a variable as a chance. Modifiers can be used in the same way as in
    ai_will_do blocks
    .
    ```
