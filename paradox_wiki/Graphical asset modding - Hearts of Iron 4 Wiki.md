Graphical assets are image files that have been defined in a `.gfx` file. This binds the image to a script name that is then referred to in the `.gui` interface files.

Graphical asset files can be found in /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/\*.gfx.

Note that for many assets, such as technology and equipment asset definitions, the image can be specified for a specific tag, i.e. `GFX_ENG_<name>`, which only displays the asset for the specified tag. This will override the base asset of the same name. This also applies to graphical culture, i.e. `GFX_african_<name>`.

# Sprite Types

### spriteType

A **spriteType** and **textSpriteType** asset entry follows this format:

```text
spriteTypes = {
    spriteType = {
        name = "GFX_<name>"
        texturefile = <path>
        noOfFrames = <int>
        effectFile = <path>

        allwaystransparent = <bool>
        legacy_lazy_load = <bool>
        transparencecheck = <bool>

        animation = {
            animationmaskfile = <path>
            animationtexturefile = <path>
            animationrotation = <float>
            animationlooping = <bool>
            animationtime = <float>
            animationdelay = <float>
            animationblendmode = <mode>
            animationtype = <type>
            animationrotationoffset = {
                x = <float>
                y = <float>
            }
            animationtexturescale = {
                x = <float>
                y = <float>
            }
            animationframes = {
                <int> <int> # etc
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**name** is the name you have given to the asset. This may be prefixed with various other segments, such as *idea* for idea images, etc.

**texturefile** is the path to the image, based of the /Hearts of Iron IV/, meaning you only include the folders within this folder, not the full filepath.

**noOfFrames** is used for images with multiple *frames* within, for example `GFX_unit_level` has five images within for each of the unit level images, and so would have `noOfFrames = 5` set within its asset definition.

**effectFile** is used to define an effect state to apply to the image, i.e. the button press effect on a button image. Effects are found in /Hearts of Iron IV/gfx/FX/\*.lua. Multiple can be defined to add multiple effects.

**allwaystransparent** defines whether or not an image can be clicked on and interacted with. If yes, the image will have no tooltip and can not be clicked on when used in game.

**legacy\_lazy\_load** defines whether the image is lazy loaded.

**transparencecheck** defines whether the image is bound by its alpha channel with regards to player clicks. Otherwise the bounding box is the image dimensions.

**animation** scope is used to add animation to an image. It uses the following attributes:

- **animationmaskfile** controls the mask image for the animation.
- **animationtexturefile** controls the color image used for the animation.
- **animationrotation** controls the rotation of the animation image. By default it is -90 clockwise.
- **animationlooping** controls whether the animation loops.
- **animationtime** controls the duration of the animation. It is measured in seconds.
- **animationdelay** controls the delay between animation loops. It is measured in seconds.
- **animationblendmode** controls the blend mode for the animation image. Can be *add*, *multiply* or *overlay*.
- **animationtype** controls the type of animation. Can be *scrolling*, *rotating* or *pulsing*.
- **animationrotationoffset** controls the *x* and *y* offsets for the rotation.
- **animationtexturescale** controls the scale of the animation image.
- **animationframes** sets the number of frames within the animation image.

Be wary that the maximum file size for a sprite .dds files is around 16MB
