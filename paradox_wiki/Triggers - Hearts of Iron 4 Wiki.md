**Conditions** (also known as **Triggers**) are used to check whether certain conditions are fulfilled in the game's current state or not, without being able to change anything in the game's state. These return a [boolean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) (true or false), which may be interpreted by the block where it's used. Usually blocks that allow using triggers are an [AND](#and) unless stated otherwise, which would instantly stop execution upon receiving a single false statement and return false.

The list of triggers may be outdated. A complete, but unsorted, list of triggers can be found in /Hearts of Iron IV/documentation/triggers\_documentation.html or /Hearts of Iron IV/documentation/triggers\_documentation.md. As of 1.17.1.1, this file was last updated in the version 1.17.0.

## Operators

Every trigger uses one of the three operators: The equality sign `=` or the comparison signs `>` and `<`.

The equality sign can either mean strict equality (Unlike previous games in the series where it checked for being equal or greater than) or can serve as a way to introduce a block of additional triggers, as in `has_opinion = { target = GRE value < -10 }`. The comparison signs serves as strict comparison: `has_political_power > 100` will not be true if the country has exactly 100 political power, for instance.

Not all triggers support the equality sign or comparison signs. See the details for each trigger in the notes for it. If not stated otherwise, the trigger only supports the equality sign.

## Context scopes

There are three general scopes all triggers operate in:

- country
- state
- character

They give context to a trigger by stating what the trigger is checking against.

Each country acts as a sub-scope of the general country scope, i.e. `GER = { }` will check only against Germany, whereas `any_country` will check against all countries. Likewise for states and characters.

Triggers won't work in scopes they are not assigned to. Country triggers will not work for states or vice-versa.

## Scopes

*Main article: [Scopes](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)*

These don't serve as triggers, but rather as scopes that change for whom the triggers are being checked. Each one also serves as an [AND statement](#and).

### Trigger scopes

### Dual scopes

The following scopes can be used either as effect or trigger scopes; some can also be used as the right side of some effects and triggers as a target. If usage as a target is possible, it's marked within the table.

Several dual scopes may have a scope that varies depending on where it's used, such as variables, which can be set to anything.

- **TAG**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Target type: Country scope
  - Example: SOV = { country_event = my_event.1 }
  - Description:
    ```text
    The country defined by the tag or tag alias. Tag aliases are defined in
    /Hearts of Iron IV/common/country_tag_aliases
    , as a way to refer to a specific country (such as a side in a civil war) in addition to its actual tag. If the country with the exact tag doesn't exist, but a dynamic country originating from the specified tag does, the scope will refer to the dynamic country.
    ```
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **<state_id>**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Target type: State scope
  - Example: 123 = { transfer_state_to = SCO }
  - Description: The state defined by this id.
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **<character>**
  - Usage: not within Character scope
  - Target type: Character scope
  - Example: ENG_theodore_makhno = { set_nationality = UKR }
  - Description: On game versions prior to 1.12.8, the character must be already recruited by the country this is scoped from.
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.11

- **mio:<MIO>**
  - Usage: Within country scope only
  - Target type: MIO scope
  - Example: mio:AST_cockatoo_doe_organization = { … }
  - Description:
    ```text
    The MIO identified by that ID as defined within the
    /Hearts of Iron IV/common/military_industrial_organization/organizations/*.txt
    file.
    ```
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.13

- **sp:<special_project>**
  - Usage: Within country scope only
  - Target type: Special project scope
  - Example: sp:sp_land_flamethrower_tank = { … }
  - Description:
    ```text
    The special project identified by that ID as defined within the
    /Hearts of Iron IV/common/special_projects/projects/*.txt
    file.
    ```
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.15

- **ROOT**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Target type: Depends on usage
  - Example:
    ```text
    ENG = {
        FRA = {
            GER = {
                declare_war_on = {
                    target = ROOT
                    type = annex_everything
                }
            }
        }
    } #GER declares war on ENG (if there is no scope before ENG)
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Targets the root node of the block, an inherent property of each block. Most commonly, this is the default scope: for example, ROOT
    within a national focus
    will always refer to the country doing the focus and ROOT
    within a event
    will always refer to the country getting the event. However, some blocks do distinguish between the default scope and ROOT, such as
    certain scripted GUI contexts
    or
    certain on actions
    . If a block doesn't have ROOT defined (such as
    on_startup in on actions
    ), then it is impossible to use it.
    ```

  - Version Added: 1.0

- **THIS**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Target type: Depends on usage
  - Example:
    ```text
    set_temp_variable = { target_country = THIS }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Targets the current scope where it's used. For example, when used in
    every_state
    , it will refer to the state that's currently being evaluated. Primarily useful for
    variables
    (as in the example, where omitting it wouldn't work) or for
    built-in localisation commands
    , where some scope must be specified. More rarely, this may help with scope manipulation when using
    PREV
    . Since omitting it makes no difference in how the code gets interpreted, there is little to no usage outside of these cases.
    ```
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **PREV**
  - Usage: Always usable
  - Target type: Depends on usage
  - Example:
    ```text
    FRA = {
        random_country = {
            GER = {
                declare_war_on = {
                    target = PREV
                    type = annex_everything
                }
            }
        }
    } #Germany declares war on random_country
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Targets the scope that the current scope is contained in. Can have additional applications where the assumed default scope differs from the ROOT, such as in state events or some on_actions. Can be chained indefinitely as PREV.PREV.
    Commonly results in broken-looking tooltips
    : what's shown to the player doesn't always correlate with reality.
    See also:
    PREV usage
    .
    ```
  - Usable as target: ✓

- **FROM**
  - Usage: Always usable

        type = annex_everything
    }

    FROM = {
        load_oob = defend_ourselves
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Can be chained indefinitely as FROM.FROM. Used to target various hardcoded scopes inherent to the block, often a secondary scope in addition to ROOT. For example:
    In
    events
    , this refers to the country that sent the event (i.e. if the event was fired
    using an effect
    , then it's the ROOT scope where it was fired).
    In
    targeted decisions
    or
    diplomacy scripted triggers
    , this refers to the scope that is targeted.

## Flow control tools

*Main article: [Scopes#Flow control tools](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#flow-control-tools>)*

These are triggers that serve as more of a way to establish a connection in how triggers are evaluated. Each one serves as a trigger scope with additional arguments and can be used regardless of scope.

- **AND**
  - Additional parameters: None
  - Example:
    ```text
    AND = {
        original_tag = GER
        has_stability > 0.5
    }
    ```
  - Description: Returns false if any sub-trigger returns false, true otherwise. Evaluation stops at the first false sub-trigger.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Only necessary within
    OR statements
    and
    NOT statements
    , as everything else is implicitly AND.
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **OR**
  - Additional parameters: None
  - Example:
    ```text
    OR = {
        original_tag = ENG
        original_tag = USA
    }
    ```
  - Description: Returns true if any sub-trigger returns true, false otherwise. Evaluation stops at the first true sub-trigger.
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **NOT**
  - Additional parameters: None
  - Example:
    ```text
    NOT = {
        has_stability > 0.5
        has_war_support > 0.5
    }
    ```
  - Description: Returns false if any sub-trigger returns true, true otherwise. Evaluation stops at the first true sub-trigger.
  - Notes: Equivalent to a NOR rather than a NAND.
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **count_triggers**
  - Additional parameters:
    ```text
    amount = <int>
    The amount of triggers that need to be fulfilled.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    count_triggers = {
        amount = 2
        10 = { state_population = 100000 }
        11 = { state_population = 100000 }
        12 = { state_population = 100000 }
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    Sums the results of all sub-triggers (false=0, true=1) and returns true if the sum is at least
    amount
    .
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.5

- **if**
  - Additional parameters:
    ```text
    limit = <trigger block>
    else_if = <if-trigger>
    Alternative condition. Optional.
    else = <AND-trigger>
    Final alternative condition. Optional.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    if = {
        limit = {
            has_dlc = "Poland: United and Ready"
        }
        has_political_power > 100
    }
    else_if = {
        limit = {
            has_dlc = "Waking the Tiger"
        }
        has_war_support > 0.5
    }
    else = {
        always = no
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    If
    limit
    is true, the sub-triggers are evaluated like an AND-trigger. If
    limit
    is false,
    else_if
    blocks are tried in sequence and finally
    else
    (if present).
    Otherwise true is returned
    .
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Both nested (As in inside of
    if = { ... }
    ) and unnested (As in the example)
    else
    and
    else_if
    exist. In case of overlap, unnested is preferred.
    Can be useful for tooltip management: same as in effects, if the limit is unmet, nothing appears. If it is met, then the limit is hidden while the condition outside of the limit appears in the tooltip.
    if = { limit = { trigger_1 = yes } trigger_2 = yes }
    is equivalent to
    OR = { NOT = { trigger_1 = yes } trigger_2 = yes }
    , but generates a different tooltip.
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **hidden_trigger**
  - Additional parameters: None
  - Example:
    ```text
    hidden_trigger = {
        country_exists = GER

  - Notes:
    ```text
    Also serves as an
    AND statement
    .
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **custom_trigger_tooltip**
  - Additional parameters:
    ```text
    tooltip = <string>
    The localisation key to use.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    custom_trigger_tooltip = {
        tooltip = sunrise_invasion_tt
        any_state = {
            is_owned_by = JAP
            is_on_continent = europe
            is_coastal = yes
        }
    }
    ```
  - Description: Hides the triggers from the tooltip shown to the player and instead uses the specified localisation key.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Alias for
    #custom_override_tooltip
    trigger (see that trigger for more info). Kept for backward compatibility. Prefer
    #custom_override_tooltip
    instead.
    Also supports
    Localisation#Bindable_localisation
    .
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.0

- **custom_override_tooltip**
  - Additional parameters:
    ```text
    tooltip = <string>
    The localisation key to use.
    not_tooltip = <string>
    The localisation key to use for NOT block. Optional.
    ```

          FLAG_DAYS = [?GER_rally_the_industrialists_in_progress_flag:days]
        }
        not_tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP_NOT
        <triggers>
    }
    ```
  - Description:
    ```text
    An
    AND
    trigger that has an overriden custom tooltip.
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    A positive tooltip can be set with
    tooltip
    and the tooltip to be used inside a
    NOT
    can be set with
    not_tooltip
    . If no positive tooltip is provided and the root key is a localization key (not a formatter, see formatted localization), then a negative tooltip will be generated by appending
    _NOT
    to the root localization for the positive tooltip. Both
    tooltip
    and
    not_tooltip
    are bindable localizations.
    Can also be used as effect.
    Also supports
    Localisation#Bindable_localisation
    .

    ```
  - Description: Checks if the specified variable exists for the current scope.
  - Version Added: 1.5

- **check_variable**
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    var = <variable>
    The variable to check.
    value = <float> / <variable>
    The value to check for.
    compare = <type>
    The type of comparison. Optional, can use < or > instead.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    check_variable = {
        var = my_var
        value = 10
        compare = greater_than_or_equals
    }
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    check_variable = {
        my_var > 10
    }
    ```
  - Description: Check the specified variable for the current scope.

    not_equals
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.5

Remember that variables need to refer to the scope they were set in. This means you can't check a country variable in a state scope without scoping the variable.

For example, to get the country variable whilst in a state scope, you'd do the following:

```text
<country> = {
    <state> = {
        limit = {
            check_variable = { from.my_country_var > 0.0 }
        }
    }
}
```

See Variables for more information.

## Meta triggers

Meta triggers are a system added with 1.6 with ![Man the Guns](media/triggers-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_58368ba2e5__img31.png)Man the Guns used in the exact same manner as [meta effects](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#meta-effects>): in order to tie a trigger block to a dynamic localisation entry. This is usually used in conjunction with [scripted localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#scripted-localisation>) for non-numerical checks. This also can serve in order to place a variable check where one is not possible.
Meta triggers work in any scope that supports triggers, including combat scope.

The following arguments go inside of a scripted trigger:

- `text = { ... }` is a trigger block used by the meta trigger. In here, any string that must be made dynamic is marked with the square brackets on each side as `[EXAMPLE]`.
- `EXAMPLE = "..."` is a string that will serve as the dynamic replacement for `[EXAMPLE]` within `text = { ... }`. This accepts [dynamic localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#namespaces>) to a limited degree, such as getting a variable's value with `[?var_name]` or some namespaces like `[ROOT.GetTag]`.
- `debug = yes`, if added, will add the final output in the [user directory](<Modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)'s /Hearts of Iron IV/logs/game.log file for debugging purposes.

For example, the following can be used with [has\_equipment](#has-equipment) to make it depend on a variable's value:

```text
meta_trigger = {
    text = {
        has_equipment = { [EQUIPMENT_ARCHETYPE] > 100 }
    }
    EQUIPMENT_ARCHETYPE = "[GetEquipmentArchetype]"
}
```

In this case, `GetEquipmentArchetype` is [scripted localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#scripted-localisation>). An example definition of scripted localisation in this case is as such:

```text
defined_text = {
    name = GetEquipmentArchetype
    text = {
        trigger = {
            check_variable = { v = 0 }
        }
        localization_key = artillery_equipment
    }
    text = {
        localization_key = infantry_equipment
    }
}
```

## Scripted triggers

Scripted triggers serve a similar purpose to [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) in that they can be defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/scripted\_triggers/\*.txt and then used elsewhere as a shortened version. Alongside that, the game has certain base game scripted triggers that are checked directly in the game's code determining triggers for functions that cannot be changed.

A scripted trigger is defined simply as

```text
scripted_trigger_name = {
    <triggers>
}
```

This example can be used as a trigger in regular code as `scripted_trigger_name = yes` or `scripted_trigger_name = no`.

For example, this would be the definition in any scripted trigger file:

```text
state_is_in_area = {
    OR = {
        state = 120
        state = 121
        state = 123
        state = 124
        state = 125
    }
}
```

This can then be used in any other trigger block, such as a national focus' available section:

```text
focus = {
    id = TAG_focus_id   # Optional attributes, other than available, have been omitted
    available = {
        capital_scope = {
            state_is_in_area = yes
        }
    }
}
```

If there are several definitions of scripted triggers with the exact same name, the game will make the scripted trigger be the one that was [evaluated later, as decided by file names and order in files](<Modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#loading-files>).

### Diplomacy scripted triggers

Diplomacy scripted triggers fall into two mutually exclusive groups: deciding availability and deciding visibility. By default, these are defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/scripted\_triggers/diplomacy\_scripted\_triggers.txt and /Hearts of Iron IV/common/scripted\_triggers/00\_diplo\_action\_valid\_triggers.txt respectively. While it is possible to also use them as regular scripted triggers, they will also modify the prerequisites of being able to do a diplomatic action between 2 countries.

A diplomacy scripted trigger is identified by the naming pattern of `DIPLOMACY_<action>_ENABLE_TRIGGER` for availability, such as `DIPLOMACY_GUARANTEE_ENABLE_TRIGGER`, and `is_diplomatic_action_valid_<action>` for visibility, such as `is_diplomatic_action_valid_stage_coup`. In the base game, diplomacy scripted triggers are used to implement the game rules and add some country-specific exceptions, such as the ![Flag of United Kingdom](media/triggers-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_58368ba2e5__img33.png) United Kingdom being unable to release its colonies with the ![Man the Guns](media/triggers-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_58368ba2e5__img34.png)Man the Guns DLC. Checking the base game's contents beforehand or copying it to the mod would ensure that the mod won't accidentally break any existing game rules.

Generally, the pattern in localisation keys used for the button usually matches up with the internal ID of a diplomatic action. If the diplomatic action doesn't already have a scripted trigger in the base game, [entirety of localisation can be searched](<Modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#searching-multiple-files>) for the name of the button to find the name of the action. For example, a the English localisation entry of  `DIPLOMACY_CALL_ALLY_TITLE:0 "Call to arms"` would suggest that the diplomatic action of calling ally to war is `CALL_ALLY`.

List of known triggers:

```text
DIPLOMACY_JOIN_ALLY_ENABLE_TRIGGER

DIPLOMACY_ASSUME_FACTION_LEADERSHIP_ENABLE_TRIGGER
DIPLOMACY_KICK_FROM_FACTION_ENABLE_TRIGGER
DIPLOMACY_SEND_VOLUNTEERS_ENABLE_TRIGGER
```

Know tokens for `is_diplomatic_action_valid_<action>` are:

- **declare\_war**, for the Declare War button
- **generate\_wargoal**, only affects the war goal menu by greying out the send button
- **guarantee**, for the Guarantee Independence button
- **docking\_rights**, for the request docking rights button
- **offer\_docking\_right**, for the offer docking rights button
- **create\_faction**, for the create faction button
- **assume\_faction\_leadership**, for the assume leadership of faction button
- **kick\_from\_faction**, for the kick from faction button
- **join\_faction**, for the ask to join faction button
- **request\_access\_to\_licence\_production**, for the negotiate license button
- **embargo**, for the embargo button
- **send\_volunteers**, only affects the sent volunteers menu by greying out the send button
- **stage\_coup**, for the stage coup button
- **boost\_party\_popularity**, for the boost party popularity button

Within a diplomacy scripted trigger, the default scope is the country that does the trigger, while [FROM](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#from>) is the target of the action. For availability, the trigger's tooltip is shown to the player when hovering over the diplomatic action; in case of country-specific restrictions, using [conditional statements](#if) can ensure that the tooltip would only be generated when needed rather than between any pair of nations.

For example, this trigger will prevent BHR from revoking a guarantee on QAT, while still ensuring the game rule works otherwise:

```text
DIPLOMACY_REVOKE_GUARANTEE_ENABLE_TRIGGER = {
    if = {
        limit = {
            has_game_rule = {
                rule = allow_revoke_guarantees
                option = BLOCKED
            }
        }
        custom_trigger_tooltip = {
            tooltip = RULE_ALLOW_REVOKE_GUARANTEES_BLOCKED_TOOLTIP
            always = no
        }
    }
    if = {
        limit = {
            tag = BHR
            FROM = { tag = QAT }
        }
        custom_trigger_tooltip = {
            tooltip = NO_REVOKING_ON_QAT_TT
            always = no
        }
    }
}
```

### Resistance initiation triggers

The behaviour of resistance being automatically initiated is decided by the `should_initiate_resistance` scripted trigger, by default defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/scripted\_triggers/00\_resistance\_initiate\_triggers.txt. If it is unfulfilled, the resistance will never initiate unless forced via the [the force\_enable\_resistance effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#force-enable-resistance>). Likewise, the resistance will always occur if it's true unless forcefully disabled.

The scripted trigger's behaviour can be overwritten with state-specific scripted triggers, which should be named `should_initiate_resistance` with the list of state IDs suffixed at the end, separated by underscores. For example, this ensures that when a state 321 or 123 is controlled by the ![Flag of United Kingdom](media/triggers-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_58368ba2e5__img35.png) United Kingdom, resistance would get initiated if and only if they're national territory of ![Flag of France](media/triggers-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_58368ba2e5__img36.png) France; otherwise, the normal behaviour is used:

```text
should_initiate_resistance_123_321 = {
    if = {
        limit = {
            tag = ENG
        }
        is_core_of = FRA
    }
    else = {
        should_initiate_resistance = yes # If this is not done, resistance would always activate due to overwriting that scripted trigger.
    }
}
```

### Useful scripted triggers

These scripted triggers are defined in base game and might be useful to keep in the mod to cut down on the amount of code. As scripted triggers, all of these use a boolean value as argument.

    ```
  - Description: Checks if the current scope is owned by ROOT or a subject of ROOT.

## References and notes

**[^](#ref-a)** **a:** Triggers are able to set and modify temporary variables. This temporary variable itself may be then used separately to change the game's state, such as in a MTTH block or if the trigger block is used in some [effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)'s `limit = { ... }` (most commonly [if statements](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#if>) or [effect scope limits](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#scope-limits>)), though the usage of the variable to change the game's state is not a trigger by itself.
