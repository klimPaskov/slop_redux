A modifier is essentially a variable used in internal calculations. However, unlike [Defines](<Defines - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>), modifiers are dynamically changeable within any modifier block. In general, modifiers are typically used to create a consistent and long-lasting effect that can be easily reversed.
Each modifier has the exact same layout: `modifier_name = 0.1`. This adds the specified value to the modifier's total value for the scope where it is applied. For example, assuming that there are no other modifiers changing that to the country, having `political_power_gain = 0.2` and `political_power_gain = -0.05` applied to the country (potentially in different modifier blocks) will result in a total of **+0.15** political power gain above the base gain. Due to how modifiers work, **a modifier with the value of 0 will always do nothing.** This also means that negative modifiers will always work and have the opposite effect of positive modifiers.
A modifier's current total value can be received as a variable by reading `modifier@modifier_name`, such as `set_variable = { my_var = modifier@political_power_gain }`. This works for countries and states, but for unit leaders, `unit_modifier@modifier_name` and `leader_modifier@modifier_name` is used instead.

The following are *not* modifiers, even if they are similar:

- Research bonuses allowing to grant a boost to a specific technology category. This is, instead, [an argument within ideas](<Idea modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#modifiers>), which can be applied in the same way for advisors, but not elsewhere.
- Equipment bonuses, such as decreasing the cost to build an equipment archetype. Similarly, this is [an argument within ideas](<Idea modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#modifiers>), which can be applied in the same way for advisors and country leader traits, but not elsewhere.
- Opinion modifiers, which can be applied to change the opinion (including trade influence) within countries, defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/opinion\_modifiers/\*.txt files.

## Applying a modifier

There are a large variety of ways to apply modifiers, but these are the primary ones:

- [Ideas](<Idea modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) - This primarily includes but is not limited to national spirits and hidden ideas. **These are the simplest way to add a modifier to a country** by using an [effect block](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>), such as a national focus reward, by using [add\_ideas](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#add-ideas>) or [add\_timed\_idea](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#add-timed-idea>). These only work for countries.
- [Dynamic modifiers](#dynamic-modifiers) - This is similar to ideas (Showing up in the same screen for countries), but they accept variables and can also be applied on states and unit leaders. **These are the primary way to add modifiers to a state.**
- Traits:
  - Country leader traits - These can be added to ideas (including advisors which function similarly) and country leaders, which'll apply on the country.
  - Unit leader traits - These can be added to unit leaders and apply effects on the leaders themselves or their units. These are the primary way to add a modifier to a unit leader.
- [Static modifiers](#static-modifiers):
  - [Global modifiers](#global-modifiers) - These are entirely hard-coded on *when* they apply, such as those used for stability and war support bonuses. However, these can be changed in *what* they apply.
  - [Provincial modifiers](#province-modifiers) - These are the primary if not the only way to apply a modifier towards a specific province.
  - [Relation modifiers](#relation-modifiers) - These are the only way to apply a targeted modifier from one country towards the other without needing to specify a specific country tag within the targeted modifier block.

Each modifier follows the same structure of being assigned a number, such as the following formatting within many blocks **that support modifiers**, such as anything listed above:

```text
modifier = { # While this is present in, for example, ideas or decisions, it's equally likely to see is modifier = { ... } being omitted entirely in other entries, such as country leader traits.
    political_power_gain = 0.1
    disabled_ideas = 1
}
```

No modifiers can have a non-numeric value, including boolean ones that must be 1 to have any effect.
Note that **modifiers do not support if statements**. The closest replica possible of one are [dynamic modifiers](#dynamic-modifiers), which allow using variables.

### Tooltip modification

Modifier blocks support, within them, the `hidden_modifier = { ... }` block, which can be used to provent the modifiers within from showing up in the tooltip. Additionally, `custom_modifier_tooltip = localisation_key_tt` can be used to add a custom localisation string to appear within the localisation as one of the modifiers. In combination, this will look like the following:

```text
modifier = {
    hidden_modifier = {
        political_power_gain = 0.1
    }
    custom_modifier_tooltip = political_power_gain_tt
}
```

Custom modifier tooltips *do not* support dynamic commands, which includes anything that uses square brackets.

## Dynamic modifiers

*If you want to apply a consistent modifier to a country, [it's easier to use ideas instead.](<Idea modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)*

Dynamic modifiers, defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/dynamic\_modifiers/\*.txt files, are a type to apply modifiers that accept variables. The modifiers are updated daily, unless the [force\_update\_dynamic\_modifier effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#force-update-dynamic-modifier>) is used to forcefully refresh the impact of modifiers. They can be applied to both countries and states, in case of the latter, the variable must be defined for the state, not for the country-owner or controller. They can also be applied to unit leaders.

Unlike ideas, **there is no way to reload definitions of dynamic modifiers** via debug mode or console, any changes to their definitions require a game restart to apply in-game. Additionally, due to the daily refresh of the variable check, these are more poorly optimised than ideas are. Due to this, when it's feasible to not use variables for a country-scoped dynamic modifier, it's both easier and more optimised [to use national spirits instead.](<Idea modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)

The dynamic modifiers are evaluated daily for each scope. The process consists of the following:

- At the beginning of each day, each variable modifier value for each dynamic modifier is temporarily reset to 0, even if the null-coalescing operator is used to assume a different number as the default. Constant values do not get reset.
- Dynamic modifiers are then evaluated in the order that they were given to the scope with `add_dynamic_modifier`.
- The variable values inside of a dynamic modifier are assumed to be 0 until every variable inside is calculated. This includes those that rely on other modifiers, which includes the `modifier@modifier_name` game variable or MTTH variables that utilise that game variable.
- After the variables are calculated for a single dynamic modifier, the modifiers apply to the scope with the dynamic modifier and the game moves onto the next dynamic modifier added to the current scope until each one is calculated.

### Arguments

- **icon** decides what is the icon used for the dynamic modifier. The icon uses a sprite defined in any /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/\*.gfx file. If the icon is not specified, it will be hidden.
- **enable** decides when exactly the dynamic modifier's modifiers apply. If the dynamic modifier is set, but the country or state it's set to does not fulfill the requirements, its effects will not apply. Optional.
- **remove\_trigger** will automatically remove the dynamic modifier upon the triggers being met. Optional.
- **attacker\_modifier** will, if set to true within a state-scoped dynamic modifier, additionally makes the modifier apply to divisions that, while not being present in the state with the dynamic modifier, are attacking an enemy located on that state. Optional, defaults to false.

Modifiers are put directly inside the dynamic modifier as a list. Non-modifier idea attributes such as `equipment_bonus` or `research_bonus` are impossible to use inside of dynamic modifiers.

### Example

```text
dynamic_modifier_name = {
    icon = GFX_idea_unknown
    enable = { always = yes }
    remove_trigger = {
        NOT = {
            has_variable = var_name
        }
    }
    political_power_gain = var_name # Variable value
    weekly_manpower = 1000 # Constant value
    stability_factor = GER.stability_var # Checks specifically GER's variable, regardless of where the modifier is applied
}
```

### Adding a dynamic modifier

Dynamic modifiers are added via the [add\_dynamic\_modifier effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#add-dynamic-modifier>). A typical addition of a dynamic modifier looks like the following:

```text
add_dynamic_modifier = { modifier = dynamic_modifier_name }
```

Since dynamic modifiers do not have assigned scopes, the same modifier can be assigned to either a country, a state, a unit leader, or several at once – this is decided only by where the `add_dynamic_modifier` effect is executed.

Within GUI, a dynamic modifier will take up these places if visible:

- For a country, a dynamic modifier will show up in the list of national spirits, appearing after the regular spirits.
- For a state, a dynamic modifier will show up in the special section for them in the bottom of the selected state view, marked with `dynamic_modifiers_grid` in /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/countrystateview.gui.

When adding a dynamic modifier, it is also possible to make it be timed or make it use a different scope as the variable's base. For example, the following code will apply dynamic\_modifier\_name to GER for 30 days, but the variables will be read off POL:

```text
GER = {
    add_dynamic_modifier = {
        modifier = dynamic_modifier_name
        scope = POL  # The modifier itself will be applied to GER, but the variables will be read off POL.
        days = 30
    }
}
```

In particular, assuming that dynamic\_modifier\_name is the example dynamic modifier created previously, if you do `set_variable = { POL.var_name = 0.3 }`, then the dynamic modifier assigned to GER as the result of this effect will give 0.3 daily political power gain. However, if the dynamic modifier scopes into ROOT for the variable as `political_power_gain = ROOT.var_name`, then `set_variable = { GER.var_name = 0.3 }` would be done.

A dynamic modifier is removed via [remove\_dynamic\_modifier](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#remove-dynamic-modifier>), phrased similarly to add\_dynamic\_modifier: `remove_dynamic_modifier = { modifier = dynamic_modifier_name }`. If, when added, the dynamic modifier had a scope assigned to it, the scope will have to be specified when removing it as well.

**Modifiers that use variables will not show up in the tooltip of add\_dynamic\_modifier**, while those that are set to a static value will. While this may make the dynamic modifier appear broken when only reading the tooltip, this will not be actually the case once it gets added. In this case, [the tooltip of the effect can be changed](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#custom-effect-tooltip>), with [the effect adding the dynamic modifier hidden](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#hidden-effect>).

## Static modifiers

Static modifiers are stored in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/modifiers/\*.txt files, where each code block within is a modifier block with the name being the ID of the static modifier. There are 5 main categories of static modifiers:

### Global modifiers

Global modifiers are applied by the hard-coded game features. Their names mustn't be changed, as the code uses them internally, but their effects can be edited. Examples of global modifiers are the penalty for non-core states or the effects of stability and war support.

### Difficulty modifiers

These are applied within /Hearts of Iron IV/common/difficulty\_settings/\*.txt files. This is used in the menu to strengthen specific countries at the game's start within game rules. If there are no difficulty settings defined, the menu will not be possible to open.
Each difficulty setting is defined as a `difficulty_setting = { ... }` block, which must lie within an overarching `difficulty_settings = { ... }` block. The following arguments can go into difficulty settings:

- `key = localisation_key` is the [localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) key used as the name of the difficulty setting as it shows up in the game rules menu/
- `modifier = static_modifier` sets the static modifier to be used by this difficulty setting.
- `countries = { ... }` is a whitespace-separated list of country tags for which the difficulty setting applies.
- `multiplier = 2.0` is a value by which the static modifier gets multiplied at the max value. As there are 5 levels for each difficulty rule, including 0, this gets split into quarters for each level, with the second being a quarter, the third being a half, and the fourth being three quarters.

An example of a difficulty setting file is the following:

```text
difficulty_settings = {
    difficulty_setting = {
        key = difficulty_weaken_GER
        modifier = weaken_country
        countries = { GER }
        multiplier = 2.0
    }
    difficulty_setting = {
        key = difficulty_weaken_SOV
        modifier = weaken_country
        countries = { SOV UKR BLR }
        multiplier = 2.0
    }
}
```

### Relation modifiers

Not to be confused with opinion modifiers. The relation modifiers apply a targeted modifier from one country towards an another one, automatically removed when the trigger is met. ROOT is the country that the modifier is applied to and FROM is the target. An example would be:

```text
test_relation_modifier = {
    valid_relation_trigger = {
        FROM = {
            has_government = ROOT		# same ruling party as ROOT
        }
    }
    compliance_gain = 0.2				# FROM's states have 20% more compliance gain when controlled by ROOT
}
```

They can be added by the add\_relation\_modifier effect, used as such:

```text
add_relation_modifier = {
    target = TAG
    modifier = test_relation_modifier
}
```

remove\_relation\_modifier, which works similarly, can remove them.

### Province modifiers

Province modifiers apply a modifier to a specific province rather than a state. They can be applied via the add\_province\_modifier effect, and removed with remove\_province\_modifier. More info on how to use these can be seen in the effects page.
An example definition looks like

```text
mod_modifier = {
    army_speed_factor = -0.5
    army_defence_factor = 0.5
    dig_in_speed_factor = 0.5
}
```

Many state-scope modifiers will work in province scope as well. In order to make the GFX in GUI, you first need to edit /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/countrystateview.gui. The icon must be defined inside custom\_icon\_container, similarly to other examples. An example definition looks like

```text
iconType = {
    name = "<modifier name>_icon"
    spriteType = "GFX_modifiers_<modifier name>_icon"
    position = { x = 0 y = 0 }
    Orientation = "UPPER_LEFT"
}
```

The spriteType you have defined needs to be defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/\*.gfx similarly to this example:

```text
spriteType = {
    name = "GFX_modifiers_<modifier name>_icon"
    textureFile = "gfx/interface/modifiers_<modifier name>_icon.dds"
}
```

### Balance of power modifiers

Balance of power modifiers typically include within of themselves the [power\_balance\_daily](#power-balance-daily) and/or [power\_balance\_weekly](#power-balance-weekly) modifiers in order to gradually tip the balance towards one side. For example,

```text
my_bop_modifier = {
    power_balance_weekly = -0.01 # Changes by 1% each week to the left, in the range of -1 to 1.
}
```

Balance of power modifiers are added via [the add\_power\_balance\_modifier effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#add-power-balance-modifier>) as such:

```text
add_power_balance_modifier = {
    id = my_bop    # The ID of the balance of power
    modifier = my_bop_modifier # The modifier to add
}
```

[The remove\_power\_balance\_modifier effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#remove-power-balance-modifier>), with the same syntax, or [remove\_all\_power\_balance\_modifiers](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#remove-all-power-balance-modifiers>) can be used to remove these from the country.

## Modifier definitions

Modifier definitions allow the creation of a custom modifier, which can be accessed as a variable when you wish to use it. After being defined, they function entirely like a new variable, being possible to read as a variable with the same `modifier@modifier_name` procedure. They will not have any effect by default and function only as a way to change the variable's value in an additive way with modifier blocks.
Each modifier token is defined within /Hearts of Iron IV/common/modifier\_definitions/\*.txt files as a separate code block, where the name of the code block serves as the ID of the modifier definition. There are the following arguments that can go inside of it:

- `color_type = good` decides the colour of the modifier's value itself. There are three values, `good`, `bad`, and `neutral`. `neutral` is permamently yellow, while `good` turns the positive values **green** and negative values **red**. `bad` is the reversal of `good`.
- `value_type = percentage` decides the way the number will show up in the tooltip. There are the following values this argument can be set to:
  - `number` will make the exact value of the modifier show up. 0.02 will show up like "Modifier definition: 0.02".
  - `percentage` will make the modifier show up as a percentage on the scale from 0 to 1. 0.2 will show up like "Modifier token: 20%".
  - `percentage_in_hundred` will make the modifier show up as a percentage on the scale from 0 to 100. 10 will show up like "Modifier token: 10%".
  - `yes_no` shows up as a boolean: anything larger than 1 will shows up as `yes`, while 0 will show up as `no`.
- `precision = 1` decides how many numbers will be shown after the period in the tooltip. For example, if it is set to 1, the tooltip will show 0.341 as if it was 0.3. Note that the game inherently does not support more than 3 decimal numbers, so it cannot be larger than 3.
- `postfix` decides what will be added after the value of the modifier in the tooltip. Allowed values are 'none' (Default), 'days', 'hours', and 'daily'.
- `category` decides on the category of the modifier. By default, the category is 'all', which makes it be in every single category. Certain tooltips will only show modifiers if they belong to a certain category. It is possible to set multiple categories for the same modifier definition by defining them one after another.

The allowed values are 'none', 'all', 'country', 'state', 'unit\_leader', 'army', 'naval', 'air', 'peace', 'politics', 'ai', 'defensive', 'aggressive', 'war\_production', 'military\_advancements', 'military\_equipment', 'autonomy', 'government\_in\_exile', and 'intelligence\_agency'.

The modifier definition's ID is also used as the [localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) key needed to change the name of the modifier depending on the currently turned on language.

### Examples

```text
modifier_definition_example = {
    color_type = good
    value_type = number
    precision = 1
    postfix = daily

    category = country
    category = state
}
modifier_definition_example_2 = {
    color_type = bad
    value_type = percentage
}
```

### Using in variables

The function of modifier definitions is to modify the value of a game variable, which can be read by other variables. You can set a variable to be equal to the sum of all values of the same modifier token in the current scope by doing `set_variable = { var_name = modifier@modifier_token_name }`. This example will set var\_name to be equal to the total value of modifier\_token\_name.

Note that, unlike countries and states, unit leaders use leader\_modifier@modifier\_definition\_name or unit\_modifier@modifier\_definition\_name in their scopes.

Example usage of making a modifier token create civilian factories in random core states monthly, in any on action file:

## Opinion modifiers

Despite their name, opinion modifiers are not related to modifiers in any way, instead they are used to modify the diplomatic or economic relations between a pair of countries.

The opinion modifiers are made in any /Hearts of Iron IV/common/opinion\_modifiers/\*.txt file as an entry in the `opinion_modifiers = { ... }` block, with the name of the entry being the ID of the opinion modifier. In case of there being several entries with the same ID, the one that was [evaluated later based on the filename and order in files](<Modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#loading-files>) will take priority, meaning that copying a base game file is never necessary in a mod.

There are the following attributes that are used in opinion modifiers:

- `trade = yes` is used to decide whether the opinion modifier changes the diplomatic relations or the trade opinion from one country to another. If unset, defaults to being false making it diplomatic.
- `value = -10` is the value of the modifier that decides by how much the diplomatic or trade opinion should change once the opinion modifier is added.
- `decay = 1` details the speed at which the opinion modifier trends towards zero monthly. Optional, defaults to the modifier not changing if unset.
- `days = 10` | `months = 2` | `years = 1` decides the time for how much the opinion modifier should last before it will get automatically removed. A month is interpreted as exactly 30 days, while a year is 365. Optional, the modifier will be permanent if neither is set.
- `min_trust = 10` | `max_trust = -10` detail the minimum and maximum value that the opinion modifier can change to. As the only non-hardcoded way to change the value of an existing opinion modifier is through decay, this can be used to limit how far it can apply.

The [localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) is created in any /Hearts of Iron IV/localisation/english/\*\_l\_english.yml file encoded in UTF-8 using the byte order mark (aka UTF-8-BOM), with the localisation key being the name of the modifier.

### Examples

Inside of a new /Hearts of Iron IV/common/opinion\_modifiers/\*.txt file:

```text
opinion_modifiers = {
    test_trade_modifier = {
        trade = yes
        value = -100    # Provides -100 trade opinion for 2 months
        months = 2
    }
    test_diplomatic_modifier = {
        value = 20      # Provides +20 diplomatic opinion that decays by 0.5 per month
        decay = 0.5
    }
}
```

Inside of a new /Hearts of Iron IV/localisation/english/\*\_l\_english.yml file:

```text
l_english:
 test_trade_modifier: "Testing trade modifier"
 test_diplomatic_modifier: "Testing diplomatic modifier"
```

### Implementation

New opinion modifiers can only be added using the [add\_opinion\_modifier effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#add-opinion-modifier>) (or the similar [reverse\_add\_opinion\_modifier](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#reverse-add-opinion-modifier>)) in any effect block, such as a [focus reward](<National focus modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#effects>), a [country history file](<Country creation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#country-history>), or an idea's [on\_add and on\_remove](<Idea modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#effects>). Similarly, already applied new opinion modifiers can only be removed with [remove\_opinion\_modifier](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#remove-opinion-modifier>). When `add_opinion_modifier` is used to apply an opinion modifier, only the country where the effect is executed will change its opinion towards the target.

There is no way to use a modifier block to directly apply an opinion modifier, but it can be simulated by adding or removing an opinion modifier at the same time the modifier block's effects are. For example, this national spirit would simulate applying an opinion modifier towards every other country that has the idea:

These modifiers are targeted, meaning that they must be used in a block for targeted modifiers rather than regular modifiers. These include `targeted_modifier = { ... }` in ideas, traits, advisors, and decisions; [relation modifiers](#relation-modifiers).
A `targeted_modifier` block is structured as such:

```text
targeted_modifier = {
    tag = FROM    # this can also take a variable that stores a scope
    attack_bonus_against = 0.1
    defense_bonus_against = 0.1

## Notes and references

**[^](#ref-a)** **a:** A few modifiers, such as [consumer\_goods\_factor](#consumer-goods-factor), instead get added in a multiplicative fashion. What this means is that, for example, `consumer_goods_factor = 0.1` and `consumer_goods_factor = 0.2` as separate ideas don't sum up to a 0.3 bonus, but instead multiply the consumer goods by

{\displaystyle (1+0.1)(1+0.2)=1.1\cdot 1.2=1.32}, resulting in a 32% increase instead of 30%.
