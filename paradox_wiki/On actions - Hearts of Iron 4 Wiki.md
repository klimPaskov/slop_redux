On actions are blocks that are executed when a certain action occurs, such as a country declaring war on a different country or a state changing control. On actions are stored in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/on\_actions/\*.txt files.

Each on action is a separate block within the `on_actions = { ... }` block, which is the root block of the on actions file. Each on\_action has up to 2 arguments:

- `effect = { ... }` is present for every single on action, being an effect block the insides of which are executed when needed.
- `random_events = { ... }` is present for on\_actions where the default scope (Same as ROOT, if not specified otherwise) is a country, such as on\_new\_term\_election. This instantly fires a random one of the specified events within with the given weights being applied. This is done with a [probability-proportional-to-size sampling](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics>)#Probability-proportional-to-size_sampling) approach.

Putting `0` instead of an event ID will ensure that nothing will happen if the chance lands on this.
Additionally, an event cannot be fired using `random_events = { ... }` if the event's `trigger = { ... }` block evaluates as false. In this case, each scope is treated the same as on action's: on action's FROM is treated as the event's FROM, same with FROM.FROM.
If there are multiple random\_events blocks, one event will be picked from each.

Note that in terms of [Scopes](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>), ROOT is the default assumed scope unless specified otherwise (in on\_actions that have THIS as a separate entity from ROOT), while FROM and FROM.FROM can serve as secondary blocks that are provided in addition.

Each on action can only be executed after the game's start, ignoring any effects done within history files or the bookmark's `effects = { ... }` section that normally would trigger one, such as [set\_politics](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#set-politics>).

## File example

```text
on_actions = {
    on_startup = {
        effect = { # NEVER FORGET! Important to include this line to distinguish it from random_events = { ... }
            every_country = {
                limit = {
                    is_ai = no
                }

                country_event = {
                    id = new_year.1
                    days = 365  # Fires on January 1 1937. Remember that leap days do not exist in-game.

            1 = germany_state_control.2 # fires one of germany_state_control.1 or germany_state_control.2
            3 = 0                       # Each has a 20% chance, and there's 60% chance nothing happens.

## General on actions

- **on_startup**
  - Description: Trigger the following commands at the first day of a new game, after country selection. Doesn't work with save loading.
  - Example:
    ```text
    on_startup = {
        effect = {
            ENG = {
                news_event = { id = news_event.1 days = 31 random_days = 27 } # Fires a news event in February 1936
            }  # assuming the default start date
        }      # Scoping into ENG is necessary, since
    }          # news_event is a country-scoped effect
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Has a default scope of
    none
    , instead of firing for each country individually as in other Paradox games such as Europa Universalis IV. Many effects that usually can be used in any scope will not work, without manual
    scoping
    into countries, states, or elsewhere.
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.3.3

- **on_daily**
  - Description:
    ```text
    Triggers each day for
    every country separately
    (performance heavy, use carefully)
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    on_daily = {
        effect = {
            if = {
                limit = { has_variable = to_be_updated_daily }
                add_to_variable = { to_be_updated_daily = 1 }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Useful for scripted guis and mods adding new mechanics (can increment a variable daily e.g.).
    Only use scoping if you're careful to avoid duplicate effects
    . This being executed for every country separately means that this is essentially equivalent to a single effect executed daily inside of every_country. e.g.
    effect = { GER = { add_political_power = 1 } }
    will add ~100 political power to
    Germany
    daily, as there being ~100 countries on the world map means that this will get executed ~100 times per day.
    ```
  - Version Added: 1.5.2
