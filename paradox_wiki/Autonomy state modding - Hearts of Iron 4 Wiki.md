Different levels of the autonomy system are defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/autonomous\_states/\*.txt, and new ones can be created.

## Arguments

- **id** is the ID of the autonomy state, unique to each one. It is necessary to define to distinguish it from other autonomy states.
- **default**: If true, the game will attempt to make the 'puppet' option in peace deals as well as the 'puppet' effect use this autonomy state among other default autonomy states. By default, set to no.
- **is\_puppet** decides whether the subject is a puppet or not, making is\_puppet and is\_puppet\_of triggers true in that case. By default, set to no.
- **use\_overlord\_color** makes the subject have the same country color as the overlord.
- **min\_freedom\_level** decides the order in which autonomy states are placed. The autonomy states with lower freedom levels have less autonomy than those with higher when the game places the autonomy states for the subject to lose or gain a level. This also decides how many autonomy points the subject needs to gain or lose a level, calculated by the difference between freedom levels multiplied by 5000. As such, it would take 500 points to go from an autonomous state with the min\_freedom\_level of 0.1 to being annexed.
- **manpower\_influence** decides how large of a portion of the subject's manpower the overlord can use in colonial divisions.
- **rule** sets the game rules for the subject to either yes or no.

## Icon

- **For loading GFX, the game uses the sprite system. Sprites are code definitions that attach a name to an image file, as well as optionally adding additional information, such as animation, the amount of frames, the way that the image will be loaded, and so on. This means**
  - Example:
    ```text
    spriteTypes = {
        spriteType = {
            name = GFX_first_sprite                         # In some cases, beginning with GFX_ is mandatory for it to work.
            texturefile = gfx/interface/folder/filename.dds # The folder and filename don't matter, as long as they are correct
        }                                                   # Only the forward slash '/' (can be doubled as '//') can be used to separate folders.
        spriteType = {                                      # The image doesn't have to be .dds, as .tga and .png are acceptable.
            name = GFX_second_sprite
            texturefile = gfx/interface/folder2/filename2.dds
            noOfFrames = 2 # Splits the image into 2 halves, which may be switched between dynamically in GUI
        }
    }
    ```

For the icon, the game will use a sprite named in the format of `GFX_<autonomy state>_icon`. An /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/\*.gfx file containing such a definition may look like the following:

```text
spriteTypes = {
    spriteType = {
        name = "GFX_autonomy_mod_new_icon"
        textureFile = "gfx/interface/autonomy/autonomy_mod_new_icon.dds"
    }
    spriteType = {
        name = "GFX_example_icon"
        texturefile = "another_folder/image_name.dds"
    }
}
```

## Localisation

The localisation is set in an .yml file in the localisation/ folder. Using the prior example of autonomy\_mod\_new, a localisation entry will look like `autonomy_mod_new:0 "Mod's new autonomy state"`

It is possible to set a country-specific entry. An entry with `GER_autonomy_mod_new:0 "New mod Germany"` will make Germany have that name if its autonomy level is autonomy\_mod\_new. Similarly, `ENG_FRA_autonomy_mod_new:0 "New mod French UK"` will make the United Kingdom have that name if its overlord is France and the autonomy state is autonomy\_mod\_new.

## Additional notes

When setting the autonomy level in the country's history file, it is possible that it will overwrite the party popularities and the ruling party of the subject. In order to prevent that to happening, it is recommended to scope into the overlord as

```text
TAG = {
    if = {
        limit = {
            has_dlc = "Together for Victory"
        }
        set_autonomy = {
            target = TAG2
            autonomy_state = autonomy_mod_new
        }
    }
    else = {
        puppet = TAG2
    }
}
```

in the subject's history file, also putting it before defining the ruling party and popularities. Alternatively, the order of tags in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/country\_tags/ can be changed so that the overlord is defined earlier than the subject.

If deciding to create a new autonomy system similar to Japan's unique autonomies, it is necessary to disable the default autonomy states so that they could not be used via `allowed = {}` in them or via `allowed_levels_filter = {}` in the new autonomies. Note that if you choose the second option, you would still need to disable the default autonomies so that they do not appear while puppeting.

If a new autonomy level should only be possible to be manually assigned via the `set_autonomy` [effect](<Effect - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>), then it's possible to set up allowed as such, using the autonomy state with the id of `autonomy_my_state`:

```text
allowed = {
    OR = {
        is_subject = no
        has_autonomy_state = autonomy_my_state
    }
}
```

That makes the autonomy state impossible to achieve through gaining or losing levels, as the `allowed` block is false if the subject has any other autonomy. This will ensure that `set_autonomy` will be possible to execute, *as long as the target country is independent at the time*, and that it wouldn't get cleared after being assigned, while it has that autonomy state.

When creating autonomy systems, avoid 2 different states having the same min\_freedom\_level.
