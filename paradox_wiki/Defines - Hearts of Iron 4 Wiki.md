Defines are exposed constants used by the game to control almost every aspect of it. They allow modders to influence systems that do not have a direct script component.

Defines are defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/defines/\*.lua files.

## Overrides

As defines are Lua code rather than a PDXscript-interpreted file, any Lua code can go in there, however modules allowing to go out of this directory are not available. As a consequence of this, **there is no need to copy the entire file to edit it**. Defines, including graphical defines, are merely a Lua-contained array, and it is possible to modify a single member of the array in Lua using, for example, `NDefines.NGame.START_DATE = "1936.1.2.12"`. Each of these lines is contained on a separate line and **there are no commas separating them**, such as the following:

```text
NDefines.NGame.START_DATE = "1936.1.2.12"

-- An unnecessary comma will result in a game crash upon launching.

NDefines.NGraphics.COUNTRY_FLAG_TEX_MAX_SIZE = 2048

-- They are present in the base game defines file due to the fact that NDefines is one single large array, and when defining an array with members, the members are separated with commas. However, commands are not separated with commas.
```

This goes into a separate file set to be evaluated after the base game defines, which is sorted by filenames using the [ASCII character IDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters). Since 0 is among the earliest characters by ID – placed before letters, other numbers, and underscores – almost any filename can work.
In the base game files, the graphical defines are set to be merged into NDefines in the last line of the base game file. However, since Lua does not create copies of tables by default, the base game's NDefines contains pointers to the actual elements, which are contained within NDefines\_Graphics regardless. For this reason, modifying either NDefines or NDefines\_Graphics works for changing graphical defines.
A mod should **never** contain the 00\_defines.lua and 00\_graphics.lua files within of itself: these files are commonly changed even in minor game updates, and having a define missing from a file results in the mod being unstable, potentially having a crash on startup.

    if distance is between [0, NEUTRAL_DIST], we lerp the cost modifier between [MIN_DIST_COST_MODIFIER, 1.0]
    if distance is between [NEUTRAL_DIST, MAX_DIST], we lerp the cost modifier between [1.0, MAX_DIST_COST_MODIFIER]

    ```text
    More explanation of the peace score distribution above:
    {1.0} would give you all the score on the first turn.
    {0.5, 0.5, 0.5} would give you 50 % of the total score on each of the first three turns (in this case resulting in receiving 150 % of the total score).
    How much of the spent peace conference score that gets refunded in a contest. First element applies for the first round of conflicts, second element for the second round of conflicts, etc. The final element is used for each consecutive turn, so setting that to e.g. 0.7 means you get 70 % of the spent score back for every turn thereafter.

    cutoff is dropped. A random design is then picked from the remaining.
    Weight is calculated as AlternativeFactor * DemandFactor.

    Dynamic intel pool can be manipulated through the following defines:

    The formula is applied as follow (runs daily):
    NextIntel = ( Intel - FLAT_DECAY ) * MULT_DECAY
    AGGREGAT_LOG_FACTOR and AGGREGAT_DIVISOR control the rate at which
    intel accumulates. It is applied to the sum of the intel generated
    throughout the day as follow:
    Aggregat = LOG_FACTOR * log( 1 + IntelOfTheDay ) + IntelOfTheDay / DIVISOR
    The Aggregat is then added to the pool of intel.
    If DIVISOR is zero then the division is evaluated to zero.
    MAXIMUMS controls the maximum value that the pool can contribute to
    the final intel values.
    ABSOLUTE_MAXIMUMS defines a ceiling for the intel in the pool that
