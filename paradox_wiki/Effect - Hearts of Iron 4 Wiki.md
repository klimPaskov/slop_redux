---

Effects (also known as Commands) are used in order to affect the game dynamically from within a specific scope. They are a one-time change to the current condition of the game, **without the ability to have a lasting effect**. Instead, [modifiers](<Modifiers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) are used to have a continuous, everlasting effect on the game's condition that can be represented with a number. Effect blocks cannot be used to apply modifiers directly, however they can add something that can apply modifiers, most commonly with [add\_ideas](#add-ideas).

Effects are used throughout the game in numerous scopes, most commonly edited effect blocks are [national focus rewards](<National focus modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>), [event options](<Event modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) and [decision effects](<Decision modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>).

Note that certain effects may take a value from a variable, i.e. `add_manpower = var:my_var` This is noted by **<variable>** in an effect's parameters. See Variables for information on the variable effects.

The list of effects may be outdated. A complete, but unsorted, list of effects can be found in /Hearts of Iron IV/documentation/effects\_documentation.html or /Hearts of Iron IV/documentation/effects\_documentation.md.

## Scopes

*Main article: [Scopes](<Scopes - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)*

Scopes serve as special effect types that modify the entity that serves as the context for the effects being executed, such as `GER = { add_political_power = 150 }` adding 150 political power to ![Flag of Germany](media/effect-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_ec2e2a02fa__img1.png) Germany.

### Effects with scopes

Effects that change the scope include the following:

- [create\_dynamic\_country](#create-dynamic-country), which changes it to the newly-created dynamic country.

### Dual scopes

The following scopes can be used either as effect or trigger scopes; some can also be used as the right side of some effects and triggers as a target. If usage as a target is possible, it's marked within the table.

Several dual scopes may have a scope that varies depending on where it's used, such as variables, which can be set to anything.

    } #GER declares war on ENG (if there is no scope before ENG)
    ```
  - Description:

    within a national focus
    will always refer to the country doing the focus and ROOT
    within a event
    will always refer to the country getting the event. However, some blocks do distinguish between the default scope and ROOT, such as
    certain scripted GUI contexts
    or
    certain on actions
    . If a block doesn't have ROOT defined (such as

    variables
    (as in the example, where omitting it wouldn't work) or for
    built-in localisation commands
    , where some scope must be specified. More rarely, this may help with scope manipulation when using
    PREV
    . Since omitting it makes no difference in how the code gets interpreted, there is little to no usage outside of these cases.
    ```
  - Usable as target: ✓
  - Version Added: 1.0

### Variables

*This section is transcluded from [Data structures § Operators](<Data structures - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md#operators>)*

The following is a list of variable-related effects and triggers. Variable-modifying effects have an equivalent for temporary variables, with `temp_variable` being used instead of `variable`, and these temporary variable operators are also valid triggers, as described above. Every operator can be used with variables that do not exist, assuming a value of 0 unless a null-coalescing operator is used.

- **set_variable**
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    var = <variable>
    The variable to modify or create.
    value = <decimal>/<variable>
    The value to set the variable to.
    tooltip = localisation_key
    Localisation used by the operation. Optional.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    set_variable = {
        var = my_variable
        value = 100
        tooltip = set_var_to_100_tt
    }
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    set_temp_variable = { temp_var = ROOT.overlord }
    ```
  - Description: Sets a variable's value to the specified amount, creating it if not defined.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Shortened version exists with
    set_variable = { <variable> = <value> }
    .
    ```

- **set_variable_to_random**
  - Parameters:
    ```text
    var = <variable>
    The variable to modify or create.
    min = <decimal>
    The minimum possible value, defaults to 0.
    max = <decimal>
    The maximum possible value, defaults to 1.
    integer = <bool>
    Sets if the variable
    must
    be an integer or if it can be decimal. Defaults to false.
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    set_variable_to_random = {
        var = random_num
        max = 11
        integer = yes
    }
    ```
  - Example:
    ```text
    set_temp_variable_to_random = my_var
    ```
  - Description: Sets a variable's value to the specified amount, creating it if not defined. The result will be greater than or equal than the minimum and strictly less than the maximum.
  - Notes:
    ```text
    Shortened version exists with
    set_variable_to_random = <variable>
    , setting it to a decimal between 0 and 1. Can be used in triggers.

  - Notes:
    ```text
    states = all
    would include every single state controlled by the country.
    If the country's current capital state is set as one of the states that the revolt can gain, it won't fire
    .
    set_capital
    can be used to change the capital beforehand, with
    on_civil_war_end
    being used to set it back to the default after the civil war ends.
    Elections will always be disallowed for the breakaway. If the
    ruling_party
    attribute is used, the original country will have its elections disallowed. In the base game files, an
    on action
    is set up to ensure that elections get allowed if the democratic side wins the civil war.
    A civil war started via this effect cannot have more than two sides and the effect cannot be used in
    history
    or
    bookmark's effect = { ... }
    . For adding more sides or starting one before the game's start, this can be simulated by setting an existing war (typically originating from a dynamic country created via
    create_dynamic_country
    ) as a civil war via
    add_civil_war_target
    .

## Flow control

These scopes are used within effect scopes to control the execution of effects.

### If statements

An [if statement](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming>)#If%E2%80%93then(%E2%80%93else)) allows an execution of effects to only be done if certain [triggers](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) are met. Conditional statements are represented with the `if = { ... }` effect. `limit = { ... }` inside of the if statement serves as a [trigger block](<Triggers - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) that defines the conditions when it should be executed, and everything else directly inside of `if = { ... }` is interpreted as the effects that should be executed if the condition is true.

For example, the following will add 10% ![Stability](media/effect-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_ec2e2a02fa__img2.png)Stability to the country this is executed on if it has positive ![Political Power](media/effect-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_ec2e2a02fa__img3.png)Political Power and below 90% stability:

```text
if = {
    limit = {
        has_political_power > 0
        stability < 0.9
    }
    add_stability = 0.1
}
```

If the limit is not met, then none of the effects inside will be executed. If it is, then each one will be. If the limit is omitted, it defaults to being always true.

**The effects must be inside of the if statement to be tied to the limit**. For example, this will always give 100 ![Political Power](media/effect-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_ec2e2a02fa__img4.png)Political Power, regardless of what country is played:

```text
if = {
    limit = { tag = BHR }
}                         # Closes if = { ... }. Since no effects are inside, this means that the if statement does absolutely nothing
add_political_power = 100 # Outside of if = { ... }, so it will always give 100 political power, even if not playing as BHR
```

Optionally, `else_if = { ... }` (with `limit = { ... }` serving in a similar fashion) and `else = { ... }` can be added. If the initial limit within `if = { ... }` is false, it moves on to the next `else_if = { ... }`, checking the limit there. If the limit there is false, then it moves on to the next one, until hitting an end or an `else = { ... }`.
Two variants exist: nested and unnested. In the first case, the `else_if` or `else` is put directly inside of the preceding `if` or `else_if`, while in the second case it's put *right after*. In case of overlap, unnested if statements are preferred. Here is an example using unnested if statements:

```text
if = {
    limit = {
        stability < 0.3 # If stability is below 30%, add 30%.
    }
    add_stability = 0.3
}
else_if = {
    limit = {
        stability < 0.6 # Otherwise, if it's below 60% (i.e. 30-59%), add 20%
    }
    add_stability = 0.2
}
else = {
    add_stability = 0.1 # If there's 60-100% stability, add 10%
}
```

Within the tooltip, only effects that would be executed are shown. The effects within an unfulfilled if statement (or an `else`/`else_if` that's not read due to the if statement being met) will be hidden from the player, and so will the trigger. In order to avoid player confusion, [custom effect tooltips can be used to tell the player what this effect block would do](#effect-tooltips), such as being used within an `else`.

### Random effects

If you want an effect to have a random chance to be done or have nothing happen otherwise, the `random = { ... }` block is the simplest way to accomplish that:

```text
random = {
    chance = 80
    add_stability = 0.4
    add_war_support = 0.3
}
```

This in particular will have an 80% chance to add 40% stability and 30% war support and, accordingly, a 20% chance to do nothing. The chance here is on the scale from 0 to 100.

If you want the game to choose between effect blocks, random\_list can be used instead. For example, if you wanted an effect to randomly given the player one out of four bonuses, you'd do the following:

```text
random_list = {
    10 = {
        add_stability = 0.5
    }
    10 = {
        add_manpower = 10000
    }
    10 = {
        add_war_support = 0.5
    }
    10 = {
        army_experience = 100
    }
}
```

The number is not the chance, but the weight for each option, as they don't have to add up to 100 or any number. An option with the weight of 20 is twice as likely to be picked as the option with the chance of 10, for instance. In total, the probability for an option to be picked is equal to the weight of the option divided by the sum of all weights.

It is also possible to use modifiers (akin to MTTH blocks) to affect the weight of each possible random effect or to use variables as chances.

```text
random_list = {
    30 = {
        modifier = {
            factor = 1.3
            has_country_flag = inward_perfect_flag
        }
        add_stability = 0.5
    }
    25 = {
        add_manpower = 10000
    }
    20 = {
        add_war_support = 0.5
    }
    my_variable = { # Taking "my_variable" as the variable's name, both "var:my_variable" and "my_variable" are valid options, left up to the developer's preference.
        army_experience = 100
    }
}
```

If the country flag inward\_perfect\_flag is set, it'll multiply the above chance of 30 by 1.3 to get 39. Meanwhile, `my_variable` will take the value of the according temp variable or the current scope's variable as the weight of the option.

Note that if you want to create a repeatable decision including a random list, by default the same decision will pick the same random result every time it is triggered in a game. You can reverse this behaviour by including the following line in the decision block:

```text
fixed_random_seed = no
```

**This is only for decisions**. Elsewhere, random seed is unfixed by default, making this argument unnecessary to set to "no".

### Tooltip manipulation

*See also: [Localisation](<Localisation - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>)*

The "tooltip" in this case refers to the text shown to the player in-game that explains what the effect block changes within the game, such as "**+50** ![Political Power](media/effect-hearts-of-iron-4-wiki_ec2e2a02fa__img5.png)Political Power".

There are 3 ways to edit the tooltip within an effect block:

- `hidden_effect = { ... }` is used in order to hide the effects within from the tooltip, making their execution not get shown to the player.
- `effect_tooltip = { ... }` is, instead, used in order to put the effects into the tooltip without actually executing them.
- `custom_effect_tooltip = my_localisation_key` is used in order to put an arbitrary paragraph of text as an effect that will get executed.

For example, this sample [focus' completion reward](<National focus modding - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki.md>) utilises all three:

```text
completion_reward = {
    hidden_effect = {
        every_subject_country = { country_event = my_event.1 }
    }
    custom_effect_tooltip = send_event_to_subjects_tt
    effect_tooltip = {
        add_political_power = 100
    }
    custom_effect_tooltip = reject_war_tt
}
```

In this case, send\_event\_to\_subjects\_tt and reject\_war\_tt are localisation keys defined within any /Hearts of Iron IV/localisation/english/\*\_l\_english.yml file encoded with UTF-8-BOM, assuming the English language.

```text
 send_event_to_subjects_tt: "Sends a demand to our every subject.\nIf they agree, we get the following for each subject:"
 reject_war_tt: "If they reject the demand, we gain a wargoal against them."
```

In-game, this will appear as such:

Noticably, the effect that fires the country event gets hidden from the tooltip. After completing the focus, the only thing that happens is that every subject country receives an event with the ID of `my_event.1`, the country does not immediately gain 100 political power.

## Meta effects

Meta effects allow you to use non-dynamic effects (the ones that do not accept modifiers and can only use static tokens or constant values) as if they were accepting variables.

```text
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = infantry_equipment_2
    amount = eq_amount
}
```

In the effect shown above, amount of equipment added is dynamic and can be set using the variable "eq\_amount". However, this effect does not let you use a variable as equipment type. You can not store "infantry\_equipment\_2" in a variable and use it here.

However, meta effects will let you use variables and scripted localization within them to build effects as if they were texts and run them. Let's make previous effect accept equipment type and equipment level as variables stored in "eq\_type" and "eq\_level".

```text
set_variable = { eq_type = 1 } # Sets the equipment type to "1", which determines the equipment given using scripted localisation, included below
set_variable = { eq_amount = 10 } # Sets the amount of equipment given to 10
set_variable = { eq_level = 2 } # Sets the equipment level to 2, which is used directly in the meta effect, no scripted localisation required

meta_effect = { # The actual meta effect. This can go anywhere you need it: in a decision, in a scripted effect, in a scripted GUI click effect, etc...
    text = {
        add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
            type = [EQ_TYPE]_[EQ_LEVEL]
            amount = eq_amount
        }
    }
    EQ_LEVEL = "[?eq_level|.0]" # Gets the "eq_level" variable and saves it as "EQ_LEVEL" for the meta effect to use
    EQ_TYPE = "[This.GetEquipmentName]" # Gets the equipment type from scripted localisation, included below, based on the "eq_type" variable, and saves it as "EQ_TYPE" for the meta effect to use
}
```

```text
# The scripted localization for the "eq_type" variable, which goes in a scripted localisation file
defined_text = { # Since the "eq_type" variable in this example is equal to 1, the equipment given by the effect is "artillery_equipment"
    name = GetEquipmentName
    text = {
        trigger = {
            check_variable = { eq_type = 0 }
        }
        localization_key = "infantry_equipment"
    }
    text = {
        trigger = {
            check_variable = { eq_type = 1 }
        }
        localization_key = "artillery_equipment"
    }
}
```

As you can see, we have created a meta\_effect that takes two arguments. These arguments will be used replacing the parameters [EQ\_TYPE] and [EQ\_LEVEL] inside the meta effect. EQ\_LEVEL will be replaced by [?eq\_level|.0] which is the integer value of eq\_level (in this case 2.000 becomes 2). EQ\_TYPE is a bit more complicated, it is being replaced by a scripted localization. This scripted localization will check eq\_type variable and depending on its value it will return the key token for the equipment. If it is 0, it will return "infantry\_equipment". If it is 1, it will return "artillery\_equipment".

So the final result is [EQ\_TYPE] is being replaced by "artillery\_equipment" and [EQ\_LEVEL] is being replaced by "2" and in the end our effect will be built as:

```text
add_equipment_to_stockpile = {
    type = artillery_equipment_2
    amount = eq_amount
}
```

which will give you 10 artillery\_equipment\_2.

debug = yes can be added to meta effects. Which will print the final effect to game.log when the effect is executed and make debugging easier.

## Scripted effects

Scripted effects serve a similar purpose to [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) in that they can be defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/scripted\_effects/\*.txt and then used elsewhere as a shortened version. **A scripted effect will never run by itself** and requires being used as an effect elsewhere to be executed. Alongside that, the game allows the creation of custom console commands, which are scripted effects.

A scripted effect is defined simply as

```text
scripted_effect_name = {
    <effects>
}
```

This example can be used as an effect in regular code as `scripted_effect_name = yes`.

Scripted effects can be accessed in console by typing `e scripted_effect_name` to run them.

To create a custom console command, the scripted effect's name should begin with `d_`. The console command itself does not include `d_`, so `d_test_command` would be run in console as `test_command`
In custom console commands, the country running the command is FROM, while ROOT is the selected country, state, or character. Anything entered after the console command, separated by spaces like `test_command 123 321 GER` is added to the 'args' temp array. An example of a scripted effect which will transfer every state entered as an argument to the country that runs the console command is

```text
d_transfer_states = {
    for_each_scope_loop = {
        array = args
        FROM = {
            transfer_state = PREV
        }
    }
}
```

used like `transfer_states 123 321`

### Useful scripted effects

These scripted effects are defined in base game and might be useful to keep in the mod to cut down on the amount of code. As scripted effects, all of these use a boolean value as argument.

    (Urban Region) gets upgraded straight to Metropolis, skipping
    large_city
    .
    ```

  - Scope: Any
  - Example:
    ```text
    lerp = yes
