# Ireland Focus Tree Canonical Source Index

Feature slug: `ireland_focus_tree`

Project: Slop Redux

Status: canonical design and implementation-handoff source set, pending the mandatory `hoi4_improvement_loop_planner` execution gate

This index is the entry point for the complete Ireland overhaul planning package. It states file authority, reading order, fixed constants, label normalisation, route coverage, package boundaries, and completion state. It contains no gameplay code and no final localisation.

# Design promise

Ireland begins as a sovereign but materially weak constitutional state shaped by the Civil War, partition, economic dependence, Church influence, parliamentary competition, republican networks, labour and rural politics, and the strategic pressure of the coming war. The focus tree is large and non-linear. Politics changes the economy, defence, diplomacy, Northern policy, laws, offices, decisions, missions, events, AI, identity and late-game order. Historical routes remain grounded. Plausible routes grow from real factions and disputes. Deliberately absurd routes require serious cultural capacity, unusual campaign conditions, verified reveal logic and a visible `H` to `P` to `A` transition.

# Source authority

When two files appear to overlap, use the following order.

1. This index and the Part 7 reconciliation files decide navigation, file ownership, normalised labels, profile type, and the composite convergence relationship.
2. The six numbered specification parts own the substantive design in their assigned areas.
3. The matching matrices are acceptance ledgers for exact constants, thresholds, rosters and lifecycle checks.
4. The matching maps explain architecture and branch interaction.
5. Historical research notes own source classification and historical uncertainty.
6. Implementation prompts own later workflow boundaries. They cannot weaken a specification.
7. Plans, validation records and improvement-loop records provide evidence and history. They do not override canonical specifications unless a finding disposition explicitly says that a repair was integrated into named source files.

A later part overrides an earlier broad statement only where the later part has explicit ownership. Part 4 therefore owns the final Dillon material gate. Part 5 owns the decision, mission, event and conclusion sequence. Part 6 owns exact AI, achievement and asset counts. Part 7 does not redesign these systems.

# Supporting final evidence

The canonical release-candidate archive includes these supporting records outside the specification directory:

- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/00_project_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/project_status.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/improvement_loop/ireland_focus_tree_improvement_loop_execution_prompt.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/improvement_loop/ireland_focus_tree_improvement_loop_execution_record.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/improvement_loop/ireland_focus_tree_parent_review.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/improvement_loop/ireland_focus_tree_finding_disposition.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/part_7_validation_report.md`
- `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/part_7_package_manifest.md`

An actual returned `hoi4_improvement_loop_planner` report must be added when the required execution becomes available. The execution record is evidence of the missing gate, not a substitute report.

# Excluded development history

Backups, raw JSON audits, temporary extraction folders, interim package manifests, continuation prompts, work plans, file lists, previous checkpoint readmes and superseded copies are not canonical implementation sources and are excluded from the canonical archive. They may remain under `docs/plans/ireland_focus_tree/` as development history.

# Canonical label registry

| Surface | Canonical working label | Clarification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| central balance | `The National Settlement` | native balance-of-power presentation plus decisions |
| material overview GUI | `National Conditions Panel` | displays Provision, Readiness, Neutrality Integrity and critical slots |
| Northern GUI | `Northern Settlement Ledger` | displays six values, settlement model, stage and regional state |
| hidden GUI | `Concealed Evidence Ledger` | displays provenance, sites, public knowledge, disqualifiers and obligations |
| historical movement | `Ailtirí na hAiséirghe` | real wartime movement name |
| durable AI profile | `Ailtirí Total State` | route profile label |
| route state identity | `Aiséirghe National State` | one possible party-state identity after victory |
| federal route | `The Fivefold Settlement` | route family label. Individual conclusions use their mapped names |
| Otherworld route | `The Compact of Two Irelands` | route family label and one possible conclusion |
| final convergence | `The Fivefold High Kingdom of Two Irelands` | composite super-conclusion, AI key `convergence_order` |
| containment classification | `P` before verified impossibility, `A` after verification | one profile may cover both stages while preserving history |

Short forms may appear in tables where the full label is already clear. They do not create separate mechanics.

# H, P and A boundary

- `H` covers documented political actors, parties, institutions, events, laws, cultural organisations, sites, folklore records and wartime practices.
- `P` covers alternate leadership, lawful constitutional change, plausible coalition, revolutionary, corporatist, federal, royal, investigative and containment outcomes grounded in those materials.
- `A` begins when the state accepts verified impossible sovereignty, sacral obligations, a pentarchy with impossible force, Otherworld authority or the final three-family convergence.

Serious cultural work remains valuable when no concealed route appears. Myth, folklore and old institutions are not presented as proof of historical political programmes.

# Route coverage

The authoritative route table is `matrices/ireland_focus_tree_route_coverage_matrix.md`. It covers all 30 AI profiles and separates:

- durable government routes
- cross-route support profiles
- recovery profiles
- the composite convergence super-conclusion

The fifteen standard Part 5 conclusion families remain fixed. The convergence profile begins only after its component conclusions pass and therefore does not create a sixteenth standard family or extra conclusion-image allocation.

# Implementation reading order

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, the relevant offline Paradox wiki pages, vanilla documentation and at least one valid local or vanilla precedent for every implementation surface.
2. Read this index and the historical research notes.
3. Read Parts 1 through 4 and their maps to understand route architecture and material constraints.
4. Read Part 5, the decision map, event map and lifecycle matrix before scripting any action or event.
5. Read Part 6 and all four Part 6 matrices before implementing AI, reactions, achievements, assets, GUI or text.
6. Read the Part 7 route and reconciliation maps.
7. Use the bounded prompts for their owned workstreams.
8. Use the coding prompt as the integration and validation order.
9. Use the goal prompt only as the final completion contract. It does not replace the detailed sources.

# Current completion state

The canonical design, route coverage, reconciliation maps, coding prompt, goal prompt and package inventory can be completed in this workspace. The mandatory `hoi4_improvement_loop_planner` execution cannot be completed because no custom subagent-spawn tool is exposed. The project must remain marked blocked at that gate until an actual returned subagent report exists. A parent-agent review and finding disposition are included as supporting evidence, but they are not the required subagent pass.
