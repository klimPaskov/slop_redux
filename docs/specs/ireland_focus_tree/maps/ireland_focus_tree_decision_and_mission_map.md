# Global objective capacity

| Campaign state | Global active cap | Reserved critical slots | Closure rule |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| normal peace | `8` | `1` | slot returns after crisis or review closes |
| Emergency or declared war | `10` | `2` | returns to 8 after 30 stable days |
| national emergency plus Northern occupation | `12` | `3` | returns when either condition closes |

Critical slots belong to component collapse, invasion, constitutional collapse, occupation security, and route review. They never host routine construction or lobbying.

# Priority queue

| Input | Priority effect |
| --- | --- |
| component at 0 or active invasion | +50 |
| constitutional or occupation collapse | +40 |
| component below 20 | +30 |
| route conclusion or six-month review | +25 |
| major historical date window | +20 |
| local damage or severe incident | +15 |
| all physical prerequisites present | +10 |
| same region and purpose already active | -20 |
| same family completed inside 90 days | -15 |
| invalid target or dead sponsor | set to zero |

# Dynamic cost map

| Action scale | Typical political cost | Typical physical burden | Typical duration | Typical risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| local | 10 to 20 political power | staff, 250 to 1,000 manpower, local equipment or one transport pool | 90 to 110 days | local consent or exposure |
| regional | 25 to 40 political power | one to two factories, trucks, trains, fuel, equipment and regional staff | 120 to 180 days | service displacement or regional backlash |
| national | 45 to 65 political power | two to four factories, major stockpile, command and administrative burden | 180 to 270 days | coalition, shortage, or dependency |
| strategic | 70 to 100 political power | four to five factories, forces, shipping, debt, access, leverage and safeguards | 270 to 365 days | constitutional failure, war, occupation, or client status |

Command power never exceeds `60`. Stockpiles use target requirements and scarcity floors. Low stocks can block an action instead of reducing its price.

# Mission collision rules

- A region cannot host two missions that require the same units, trains, convoys, port capacity, or factories unless the tooltip shows the split and both remain feasible.
- A national emergency mission can pre-empt one routine mission. The routine mission pauses and does not fail during the pause.
- A route transition cancels missions owned only by the defeated authority. Shared public-service and humanitarian missions transfer after an office and funding review.
- A sponsor mission ends immediately when the sponsor is invalid. Delivered goods remain. Promised goods vanish. Debt and exposure remain.
- A Northern settlement mission and an occupation mission cannot apply to the same district under contradictory authority.
- A hidden evidence mission never occupies a critical Provision, invasion, or occupation slot.

# Part 6 handoff

Part 6 receives category icon families, AI priority inputs, objective state types, map-region names, mission success and disqualifier flags, and achievement hooks. It cannot change category ownership, active caps, critical-slot rules, or the requirement for concrete objectives.
