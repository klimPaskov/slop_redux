# Ireland Focus Tree Specification

## Part 5: Decisions, events, and lifecycles

Feature slug: `ireland_focus_tree`

Planning status: Part 5 of 7

This specification defines the active decision, mission, event, office, law, idea, identity, occupation, settlement, and cleanup layer for the Ireland overhaul. It does not contain implementation code or final localisation.

All structural labels are working labels. Historical people, institutions, laws, and dated events retain their proper names. Documented history is marked `H`, plausible speculation is marked `P`, and deliberate absurdity is marked `A`.

# Part 5 design result

Part 5 turns the political and statecraft architecture from Parts 1 through 4 into a playable sequence of actions and consequences. The package provides 140 mapped decision actions, 54 mapped objective families, eighteen historical chain families, eighteen political crisis families, twelve foreign reaction families, and a minimum of 236 planned route, regional, and institutional flavour events. Major-chain events sit outside the flavour minimum.

The player manages a limited set of visible objectives. Routine programmes compete for administrative capacity. Severe shortages, constitutional collapse, invasion danger, active occupation, and route reviews reserve objective slots so they cannot disappear behind ordinary projects.

The action layer preserves every fixed opening value and threshold from the completed package. Decisions can move values and create institutions. They cannot rewrite the opening constants, erase previous history, grant free offices, create undelivered equipment, or convert control into cores.

# Classification and historical boundary

| Class | Use in Part 5 | Required presentation | Rejection condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `H` | documented events, institutions, dates, offices, policies, organisations, crises, and social conditions | source-backed context and historically plausible choices | alternate outcome presented as inevitable history |
| `P` | alternate elections, coalitions, route transitions, negotiated settlements, early development, foreign bargains, and lawful institutional changes | clear causal bridge from a real dispute or institution | free transformation with no mandate, capacity, or opposition |
| `A` | concealed royal, provincial, folkloric, and Otherworld sovereignty after the full reveal gate | explicit transition from serious cultural work to impossible content | myth or supernatural authority presented as documented fact |

Real suffering remains serious. Maritime deaths, bombing, internment, political killing, sectarian conflict, antisemitism, repression, detention, poverty, and forced labour do not use cheap comedy.

# Fixed inherited constants

## The National Settlement

- Range `-100` to `+100`.
- Opening value `+25`.
- Opening Settlement Momentum `-1`.
- Momentum range `-5` to `+5`.
- Each momentum point moves the balance by `2` per monthly update.
- Maximum monthly momentum movement is `10`.
- Stage changes require seven days beyond a boundary.
- Returning across a boundary requires a five-point margin.
- Route commitment preserves the current value, clamps it between `-60` and `+60`, changes pole labels, removes obsolete contributors, and begins a six-month review.

The seven fixed stages remain Revolutionary Command, Armed Dual Authority, Revolutionary Ascendancy, Negotiated Settlement, Constitutional Ascendancy, Executive Consolidation, and State Monopoly.

## Opening companion and stakeholder values

Social Consent opens at `55`. National Readiness opens at `15`. British Leverage opens at `45`. Vatican Leverage opens at `25`. American Leverage and German Leverage each open at `5`.

Cabinet Cohesion opens at `65`. Dáil Mandate opens at `55`. Administrative Reach opens at `70`. Security Loyalty opens at `65`. Republican Network Strength opens at `35`. Labour Organisation opens at `35`. Church Institutional Influence opens at `65`. Rural Organisation opens at `55`. Minority Confidence opens at `45`.

## Parliamentary arithmetic

The Dáil has `153` formal seats and `152` routine confidence votes. Fianna Fáil opens with `77` formal seats and `76` routine government votes because the outgoing Ceann Comhairle occupies one seat. Fine Gael inherits `59` seats from predecessor parties. Labour has `8`. Other deputies have `9`. The Ceann Comhairle Reserve is never an ordinary party vote.

## National Provision

Food Security opens at `55`. Energy Continuity opens at `25`. Transport Serviceability opens at `40`. Maritime Access opens at `30`. Their mean is `37.5`, displayed as `38`.

A component below `20` caps National Provision at `35`. Two or more components below `30` cap it at `45`. A component at `0` begins a national emergency.

## National Readiness

Command and Training opens at `25`. Equipment Sufficiency opens at `8`. Mobilisation Depth opens at `20`. Supply and Mobility opens at `12`. Coastal and Air Warning opens at `5`. Maritime Protection opens at `5`. Intelligence Coordination opens at `30`. Their mean is `15`.

The fixed bottlenecks and route gates from Part 4 remain authoritative. Dillon retains the complete Part 2 political gate and the canonical Part 4 material gate. A looser copy of the continuation handoff omitted several Part 4 conditions. That copy is stale. This Part 5 package preserves National Provision `50` with no component below `30`, Maritime Access `40`, Transport Serviceability `40`, Equipment Sufficiency `40`, Command and Training `40`, Supply and Mobility `40`, a protected home-defence reserve, a defined military contribution, and enforceable access, command, customs, finance, Northern, withdrawal, and review safeguards.

## Neutrality Integrity and Northern settlement

Neutrality Integrity opens at `72` in September 1939. The fixed bands remain Credible Armed Neutrality, Practised Neutrality, Selective Neutrality, Compromised Neutrality, and Neutrality Breakdown.

The Northern Settlement Ledger opens at Unionist Consent `5`, Nationalist Consent `40`, Labour Cooperation `30`, British Flexibility `10`, Security Stability `45`, and Integration Capacity `10`. The values remain separate. Federal, unitary, labour, wartime, plebiscite, coercive, integration, and core thresholds remain fixed.

# Global action architecture

An early internal draft used eight broad category shells and allowed compulsory crises to sit outside the ordinary objective cap. The reconciliation pass rejected that model. Elections, underground transitions, foreign leverage, occupation, and postwar settlement created different target pools, expiry rules, and cleanup risks, while uncapped crisis work allowed excessive parallel activity. The canonical model therefore uses thirteen phase-gated categories under one shared national cap. Critical work reserves capacity inside that cap, and emergency conditions raise the cap only through the fixed `8`, `10`, and conditional `12` ladder.

## Decision-category roster

| Category | Normal visibility | Active mission cap | Owns | Slot rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| National Settlement and Government [working] | opening onward | 2 | cabinet, confidence, constitutional review, succession, caretaker government | one constitutional crisis slot is reserved |
| Elections and Coalition Formation [working] | campaign, dissolution, scheduled election, government formation | 2 | registers, candidates, transfers, coalition charter, ministries | one election mission and one formation mission |
| Organised Society [working] | opening onward, route filtered | 2 | Labour, rural organisations, Church domains, vocational councils, minority safeguards | one national negotiation and one regional delivery mission |
| Cultural and Archival Work [working] | opening serious lane, concealed stages after valid evidence | 2 | language, folklore, archives, sites, provincial culture, false leads | one public cultural project and one evidence mission |
| Radical and Underground Transition [working] | only after a valid crisis or movement gate | 2 | IRA, Congress, O'Duffy, Ailtirí, clerical capture, route transition | one organisational mission and one seizure or constituent mission |
| National Provision [working] | opening onward | 3 routine, 4 in national emergency | food, energy, transport, shipping, industry, housing, regional delivery | one slot is reserved for a component below 20 |
| National Readiness [working] | opening onward | 3 routine, 4 during invasion danger or war | training, equipment, mobilisation, mobility, warning, maritime protection, intelligence | one slot is reserved for an exposed frontier or compromised plan |
| Neutrality and Incidents [working] | September 1939 onward or earlier war spillover | 2 routine, 3 during direct incident | airspace, shipping, internment, intelligence, weather, access, censorship, border | an unresolved severe incident occupies one slot |
| Foreign Leverage and Agreements [working] | when a valid partner channel exists | 2 | Britain, United States, diaspora, Germany, Vatican, neutral states | one active mission per sponsor |
| Northern Settlement [working] | contact, negotiation, confidence measure, plebiscite, convention, or war planning | 3 | local actors, British position, consent, security, integration preparation | one political, one local, and one security or economic mission |
| Occupation and Integration [working] | after military control, provisional settlement, or lawful transfer | 3 | administration, policing, services, finance, industry, rights, demobilisation | one security, one service, and one constitutional slot |
| Regional Orders and External Ambitions [working] | after route and capacity gates | 2 | Celtic cooperation, Atlantic structures, protectorates, liberation, royal, provincial, compact orders | one institution mission and one contribution or conflict mission |
| Postwar Settlement [working] | major war end, Emergency review, or 1945 onward | 3 | demobilisation, controls, reconstruction, republic, Commonwealth, UN, alignment, Northern review | one legal, one material, and one diplomatic slot |

No campaign should show all thirteen categories as full trays of actions. Categories enter dormant, available, active, emergency, transformed, review, cleanup, and archived states. A visible header shows current values, active projects, urgent risks, and the next review date.

## Category lifecycle

| State | Entry condition | Player presentation | Objective capacity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dormant | preconditions are absent | header hidden, persistent history retained | no active objectives |
| available | valid route, date, law, or crisis gate | header visible with current values and available actions | normal cap |
| active | one or more actions or missions are running | costs, timers, targets, and consequences shown | normal cap and priority queue |
| emergency | component at 0, severe incident, constitutional collapse, invasion, or occupation crisis | critical actions move to top and a reserved slot opens | category emergency cap |
| transformed | route commitment changes the institution or governing authority | obsolete actions close, valid successors open, inherited history stays | new route cap |
| review | six-month settlement review, postwar review, or integration review | completion and failure tests are visible | review objective reserves one slot |
| cleanup | government replacement, route closure, peace, withdrawal, or failed reveal | targets, temporary ideas, flags, and event chains are resolved | no new routine actions |
| archived | system is resolved or replaced | history remains available to events and achievements | zero active objectives |

## Global active-objective cap

The normal global cap is `8` active timed missions. The Emergency or a declared war raises it to `10`. Simultaneous national emergency and Northern occupation can raise it to `12`. The highest cap is temporary and ends when either emergency closes.

Critical missions reserve space. A component at `0`, a severe neutrality incident, a constitutional collapse, an invasion mission, an occupation security crisis, or a route six-month review receives a reserved slot. Routine projects cannot occupy that slot.

If the global cap is full, the queue uses the following priority score.

| Priority input | Score direction |
| --- | --- |
| component at `0` or active invasion | `+50` |
| severe constitutional or occupation crisis | `+40` |
| component below `20` | `+30` |
| route conclusion or six-month review gate | `+25` |
| major historical date window | `+20` |
| active local damage, port loss, corridor break, or camp escape | `+15` |
| valid target and all physical prerequisites present | `+10` |
| another active mission already covers the same region and purpose | `-20` |
| same family completed in the previous 90 days | `-15` |
| dead sponsor, invalid authority, inaccessible target, or closed route | priority set to zero |

A queued mission does not apply failure effects until it becomes active. A critical mission that cannot enter because every reserved slot is already occupied replaces the lowest-priority routine mission. The displaced mission pauses without duplicating rewards.

# Dynamic cost and duration model

## Action Burden Score

Every substantial action receives an Action Burden Score from `1` to `10`.

- Scope adds `1` for local, `2` for regional, `3` for national, and `4` for strategic or all-island action.
- Urgency adds `0` to `2`.
- Scarcity adds `0` to `2` based on the affected stockpile or component.
- Security and exposure add `0` to `2`.
- Repetition adds `0` to `2` for the same action family inside one year.
- Existing institutions can subtract up to `2` when they are funded, staffed, lawful, and not captured.

The score sets cost bands. It never makes a large action cheap because the country is already poor. Low stockpiles increase scarcity and can block the action.

## Cost layers

| Cost layer | Low burden | Medium burden | High burden | Strategic burden | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| political power | `10` to `20` | `25` to `40` | `45` to `65` | `70` to `100` | used for genuine political and administrative work |
| command power | `5` to `10` | `15` to `25` | `30` to `45` | `50` to `60` | never exceeds `60` |
| service XP | `5` to `10` | `15` to `25` | `30` to `40` | `45` to `60` | army, navy, or air XP follows the action |
| tied civilian factories | `1` | `1` to `2` | `2` to `4` | `4` to `5` | tied for the project duration |
| manpower | `250` to `1,000` | `1,000` to `3,000` | `3,000` to `8,000` | route and force based | does not replace equipment and training |
| equipment | local floor | regional floor | formation or network requirement | campaign requirement | uses target force, network, or project need |
| transport | trucks, trains, fuel or convoys tied to route | scaled by distance, damage and season | major corridor or fleet commitment | multi-region obligation | released only through cleanup |
| political values | small stakeholder movement | one meaningful tradeoff | route or coalition concession | legitimacy, dependence, exposure, or constitutional cost | effects must be visible |

Cancellation returns at most `70` percent of recoverable physical inputs. Wages, consumed fuel, lost equipment, political concessions, exposure, and completed construction are not refunded. Repeating the same aid, ship, unit, factory, claim, or influence action inside one year raises cost and reduces AI priority.

## Duration bands

- Immediate incidents use `30` to `75` days only when the danger is already active.
- Routine local missions use `90` to `110` days.
- Regional delivery missions use `120` to `180` days.
- National programmes use `180` to `270` days.
- Constitutional transformation, occupation integration, and major construction use `270` to `365` days.
- Seasonal agricultural and fuel missions follow planting, harvest, winter, or drying windows.

Goal missions auto-complete when the objective is satisfied. The player does not pay a second cost after doing the work.

# Event architecture

## Event memory model

Events read persistent history rather than only current ideology. The state record includes elections, coalitions, office holders, party splits, route transitions, major laws, incidents, foreign agreements, ship losses, camps, military plans, Northern negotiations, occupations, integration stages, hidden evidence, and route conclusions.

Each event family records:

1. actor and scope
2. historical class
3. trigger and date window
4. player knowledge and remaining uncertainty
5. options and route variants
6. immediate value, law, office, resource, map, or mission effects
7. long memory and follow-up
8. AI intent passed to Part 6
9. image, icon, GUI, quote, remark, or audio need passed to Part 6
10. cleanup after closure or route invalidation

News events are reserved for internationally visible constitutional changes, war entry, major bombing, state creation, Northern settlement, regional-order formation, and impossible public transformations. Domestic report events carry government, shortage, military, social, and cultural developments. Hidden bookkeeping events remain invisible and cannot replace visible consequences.

## 1937 Constitution sequence

The constitutional chain contains separate drafting, campaign, plebiscite, election, commencement, presidency, Seanad, and implementation nodes. The plebiscite result never substitutes for the election result. A Constitution that passes under a minority government creates coalition and legitimacy gameplay. A failed plebiscite preserves the prior constitutional framework and opens a new settlement crisis rather than deleting the political tree.

## 1938 settlement sequence

The agreements chain treats trade, finance, defence, and port transfer as related agreements with separate delivery. Port transfer records inventory, guns, magazines, maintenance, personnel, access, and the defence burden. Cobh, Berehaven, and Lough Swilly receive distinct transfer and commissioning events. The transfer event never grants effective defence by itself.

## Emergency sequence

The Emergency chain opens Neutrality Integrity at `72` only after the lawful September 1939 steps. It then starts the first six-month neutrality review, mobilisation, censorship, supply, internment, and diplomatic notification chains. An alternate route can change the doctrine, though it must still pass law, government, public consent, access, and capacity gates.

## Belfast Blitz sequence

The Belfast chain contains at least eight player-facing nodes: prior air-defence concern, the Dockside raid, the Easter Tuesday raid, the relief request, southern fire and medical assistance, refugee and family movement, industrial and labour disruption, later raids, and recovery. Humanitarian relief can improve confidence without granting political settlement. Aid can be refused, limited, politicised, or exploited. Each choice affects Neutrality Integrity, British Flexibility, local consent, security, labour, Provision, and future Northern negotiations.

## The 1940 proposal sequence

The 1940 chain requires the fall of France and a viable British government. It records the British unity principle, joint committee and defence proposal, de Valera's immediate united-neutrality counterposition, arms and guarantee questions, cabinet views, unionist opposition, Northern nationalist and labour reactions, American guarantee speculation, and final response. Historical rejection remains the normal AI result. Alternate outcomes need all fixed wartime bargain and statecraft gates.

# Political crisis chains

| Crisis family | Trigger | Choice structure | Persistent result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lost Confidence and Presidential Choice [working] | government loses vote, Taoiseach seeks dissolution | alternative nomination, dissolution, caretaker, constitutional confrontation | mandate, President, party and office cleanup |
| Fianna Fáil Succession [working] | de Valera retirement, presidency, failure, or lawful party contest | Lemass, loyalist continuity, delayed succession, party split | Developmental Standing, cabinet, party, Dáil |
| Fine Gael Leadership 1944 [working] | Cosgrave retirement and party vote | Mulcahy, O'Higgins parliamentary bridge, Costello compromise, opposition crisis | party leader, parliamentary leader, Taoiseach separate |
| Dillon Break with Fine Gael [working] | 1942 intervention dispute | resignation, independent platform, party conversion, failed mandate | Dillon route and neutrality consensus |
| Labour and National Labour Split [working] | affiliate, Larkin, O'Brien, candidate and anti-communist disputes | unity, National Labour, later reunion, coalition red lines | party, union, seat and advisor state |
| Clann na Talmhan Foundation and Merger [working] | 29 June 1939 onward | Athenry foundation, 1940 test, 1943 merger, Donnellan, Cogan, Blowick | party and agrarian support bloc lifecycle |
| Church Education Crisis [working] | funding, inspection, language or minority dispute | compact, state provision, episcopal veto, public backlash | Church domains and minority confidence |
| Health and Welfare Authority Crisis [working] | state expansion or service failure | mixed board, public service, Church contract, veto state | service dependency and organised society spirit |
| Emergency Powers Abuse [working] | orders expand without review or target opposition | narrow law, Dáil review, court challenge, permanent emergency | government and law lifecycle |
| Military Command Crisis [working] | army, armed wing, party guard, crown guard or provincial guard rejects civil authority | subordination, compromise, purge, coup, fragmentation | National Settlement and Readiness |
| IRA Leadership Crisis [working] | Russell absence or death, Hayes crisis, arrests, local command refusal | Twomey, Barry, Hayes, McAteer, Kerins, White or civil compact | office, command, cohesion and exposure |
| Republican Congress Constituent Crisis [working] | common programme or armed-wing dispute | plural congress, one-party directorate, coalition collapse, constitutional recovery | Labour and movement histories |
| O'Duffy Personal Command Crisis [working] | veteran refusal, army resistance, foreign patron, death on 30 November 1944 | succession, corporate oligarchy, constitutional restoration, collapse | personal office and movement state |
| Ailtirí Exposure and 1945 Split [working] | police exposure, public launch, regional conflict, foreign defeat | suppression, party state, rival factions, underground continuation | cells, Ceannaire office, antisemitic and coercive law |
| Clerical Guardianship Capture [working] | service dependency, veto, council bypass | constitutional guardianship, producer settlement, clerical veto state, restoration | Church and state offices separate |
| High Kingship Convention Crisis [working] | candidates, provinces, President, Dáil and succession conflict | constitutional crown, sacral crown, empty crown, abolition | royal legitimacy and public law |
| Five Provinces Veto Crisis [working] | one or more provincial mandates reject common policy | federal bargain, confederation, central override, secession | Federal Cohesion and provincial mandates |
| Otherworld Compact Breach [working] | obligation fails or human authority is displaced | penance, renegotiation, containment, dominion, restored stewardship | Obligation Ledger, sites, public law |

A crisis does not replace the normal decision system. It changes category state, reserves a mission slot, and defines a deadline. Recovery can restore constitutional procedure, create a route transition, or leave a durable failure form.

# Foreign reaction chains

| Actor family | Main triggers | Reaction range | Persistent state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Britain | neutrality enforcement, Treaty Ports, Plan W, shipping, war entry, Northern settlement, republic | trade and aid, protest, access demand, recognition, guarantee, ultimatum, withdrawal | British Leverage and dependency indicators |
| Northern Ireland government | Dublin claim, border incidents, relief, plebiscite, federal or coercive route | refusal, limited cooperation, security mobilisation, representation, appeal to London | Unionist Consent and Security Stability |
| United States government | neutrality, procurement, ports, diaspora pressure, postwar aid, UN | licence, criticism, credit, access pressure, recognition, support | American Leverage and debt |
| Diaspora organisations | partition, neutrality, labour, fascism, humanitarian relief, republic | fundraising, lobbying, split campaign, boycott, volunteers, press | organisation-specific support and domestic legitimacy |
| Germany | neutrality, agents, IRA or Ailtirí contact, ports, weather, Axis defeat | promise, delivery, propaganda, pressure, extraction, abandonment | German Leverage, exposure and client risk |
| Vatican | humanitarian cases, Church disputes, communism, authoritarianism, antisemitism, mythic routes | mediation, recognition, criticism, private pressure, refusal | Vatican Leverage separate from domestic Church |
| Commonwealth states | war contribution, republic, citizenship, trade, regional order | recognition, concern, aid, legal adjustment, defence consultation | bilateral relationships and organisation legitimacy |
| Neutral and small states | shipping law, internment, consultation forum, postwar institutions | support, refusal, shared legal position, exit under pressure | forum cohesion and diversification |
| Allied powers | deep cooperation, belligerency, access, intelligence, Northern war | aid, command demand, recognition, occupation concern, postwar settlement | cooperation depth and sovereignty safeguards |
| Axis powers | German or Italian contact, ports, intelligence, ideological routes | aid promise, recognition, coercion, sabotage, collapse | sponsor viability and dependency |
| Postwar organisations | UN application, reconstruction, humanitarian, trade and security order | admission, delay, conditions, aid, monitoring | recognition and postwar conclusion |
| Celtic regional actors | culture, federal, crown, liberation or impossible order | cultural cooperation, cautious diplomacy, refusal, local opposition | no sovereignty without local mandate |

Part 6 consolidates AI reaction weights. Part 5 fixes the valid reaction vocabulary, the affected leverage or consent values, and the agreement, access, guarantee, recognition, or withdrawal state created by each response.

## Temporary idea families

Temporary ideas can represent a project, shortage, mobilisation tier, incident, camp, access agreement, occupation stage, integration stage, reconstruction programme, or route review. Every temporary idea has an expiry trigger, replacement path, or cleanup action.

# Party, coalition, and parliamentary lifecycle

| State | Entry | Active records | Exit | Cleanup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| registered party | valid historical foundation or explicit alternate foundation | party leader, executive, candidates, seats, programme | dissolution, merger, prohibition, route replacement | seats transfer only through election, defection, merger or legal order |
| parliamentary party | one or more formal seats | formal seats, routine votes, whip, parliamentary leader | election loss, split, merger | update formal and routine ledgers separately |
| support bloc | named issue and eligible deputies | issue, promised votes, expiry, concessions | vote completed, agreement breached, election | remove support votes and retain concession history |
| coalition negotiation | no single majority and valid partners | red lines, offers, offices, programme | charter, failure, election | remove rejected offers and provisional offices |
| coalition government | 70 routine votes and ratified charter | Taoiseach, cabinet, party leaders, review date | collapse, election, route overthrow | return portfolios, cancel charter benefits, preserve enacted law |
| party split | dated dispute and organisational threshold | successor parties, seats, leaders, affiliates, assets | reunion, extinction, merger | preserve separate histories and coalition red lines |
| underground movement | valid repression or clandestine route | cells, command, public wing, exposure | legalisation, suppression, seizure, dissolution | disarm, integrate, exile, prosecute or archive named bodies |
| ruling body | valid election, constituent process, seizure, crown or compact law | government authority and route decisions | defeat, restoration, succession | remove government access without deleting movement or party history |

Clann na Talmhan cannot exist as a national party before 29 June 1939. National Labour follows the 1944 split. Ailtirí follows its wartime emergence gate. The IRA remains a clandestine armed and political network unless a valid route transition creates a public authority.

Every law family has a public entry event, visible review date, abuse state, and exit. Emergency laws do not vanish because the European war ends. They move through review, postwar replacement, narrowing, expiry, or failure.

# Country identity, territorial status, and international order

| Surface | Opening state | Valid transition | Exit or reversal | Hard rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| country name and adjective | opening constitutional identity | changes after lawful republic, route victory, crown, federation, party state, occupation or compact | reverts or changes after restoration, collapse or succession | never changes from a focus icon alone |
| flag | historical tricolour unless valid route state says otherwise | historical or attested flags are sourced, alternate flags are generated | restore prior lawful flag on route reversal | flag change follows political victory and law |
| ruling party or body | party and coalition ledger | changes after election, constituent process, seizure, council settlement or crown law | defeat, dissolution, restoration, occupation | popularity alone does not create government |
| cosmetic tag | none or constitutional identity | activated with leader, party, law, ideas and AI profile | removed when route ends | no cosmetic tag substitutes for institutions |
| claim | constitutional, historical, route or war claim | created through law, diplomacy, convention, conflict or route evidence | withdrawn, settled, inherited or disputed | claim does not grant control, consent or core |
| core | opening legal cores only | granted after valid integration and final tests | can be suspended or reviewed only through explicit extreme route rules | Northern cores require integration stage 5 |
| occupation | none | military control creates zones, resistance, law and administration | ends through withdrawal, settlement, annexation review or liberation | ownership is not administration |
| protectorate or subject | none | requires treaty or conquest settlement, rights, finance, defence, exit and recognition | exit, integration, collapse or transfer | no free subject from one decision |
| guarantee | none or existing external relationship | time-limited, monitored, security or joint guarantee with scope | review, normalisation, withdrawal or breach | guarantee is not permanent foreign veto unless failure state |
| faction or regional order | none or existing world faction | charter, members, contribution, command, goals, exit and AI | dissolution, member exit, defeat or successor order | cultural contact is not faction membership |

# Cleanup architecture

| Trigger | Mandatory cleanup | Preserved history | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| government replacement | cancel government-only decisions, confidence missions, provisional ministers and private agreements | retain election, party, Dáil and historical office records | new government revalidates laws and foreign agreements |
| election defeat | remove campaign modifiers, candidate promises and temporary popularity actions | retain seats, party organisation, debts and coalition red lines | update opposition and succession access |
| coalition collapse | end charter benefits, return portfolios, clear support votes, start caretaker or election | retain policy concessions already enacted and breach memory | no duplicate cabinet offices |
| leader death or resignation | vacate only held offices, cancel personal missions, start valid succession | retain party, government and movement institutions | historical date pressure applies unless alternate survival was earned |
| route transition | archive old category actions, transform National Settlement labels, clamp value, start six-month review | retain all historical ledgers and material conditions | no reset to ideal values |
| war entry | close incompatible neutrality restoration actions, review internment, access and censorship | retain incident history, obligations and public law | open belligerency, home defence and contribution missions |
| peace and demobilisation | end war-only access, mobilisation, requisition and operational missions | retain veterans, debt, damage, equipment and foreign obligations | start postwar reviews |
| sponsor defeat or withdrawal | cancel deliveries, advisers, access and sponsor-only decisions | retain debt, exposure, local clients and captured equipment | open replacement, neutrality restoration or client-collapse chain |
| Northern settlement | close claim-only, war-only or negotiation-only actions according to model | retain consent, security, representation and guarantee history | open stage-specific integration category |
| occupation end | remove military zones, requisition and occupation offices | retain damage, resistance, collaborators, debt and service records | open withdrawal, restoration or integration review |
| core grant | close integration remediation only for passing regions | retain rights and service review history | no blanket core grant across failed districts |
| false cultural lead | remove evidence and reveal flags tied to the false claim | retain serious archive, language and site benefits | open public explanation, fraud or recovery event |
| hidden route failure | remove exceptional offices, due obligations and impossible actions | retain damage, public knowledge, sites and historical institutions | open constitutional, provincial, crown or stewardship recovery |
| compact breach | suspend exceptional benefits, mark due obligations failed, open containment or penance | retain human law and site state | do not erase ordinary Provision or security burdens |
| regional order dissolution | remove shared decisions, commands, temporary contributions and offices | retain bilateral treaties, debt and war consequences | resolve members and subjects individually |
| postwar conclusion | expire temporary crisis modifiers, close unresolved projects or convert them into dated programmes | retain final three spirits, laws, offices and identity | route conclusion cannot hide an unresolved crisis |

Cleanup is idempotent. Running it twice cannot grant refunds, duplicate offices, remove a valid successor, repeat a core grant, or erase current route state.

# Route conclusion chains

| Route family | Mandatory proof | Success identity | Failure or blocked identity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| de Valera constitutional stewardship | valid Taoiseach or lawful successor, reviewed emergency, Provision and Readiness settlement, neutrality or foreign policy, Northern policy, tricolour or lawful republic identity | Republic by Consent or Sovereign Executive variant | party-state fusion, permanent emergency, unresolved partition crisis |
| Lemass developmental republic | lawful succession, delivered projects, social bargain, foreign safeguards, postwar programme | Developmental Republic | Government of Boards, dependency, rural alienation |
| Fine Gael constitutional state | valid party and government offices, coalition or majority law, civil military authority, emergency review | Constitutional Continuity Reconciled or Civil Authority Secured | army shadow, coalition collapse |
| Costello coalition republic | coalition charter, legal review, Republic settlement where chosen, external relations | Coalition Constitution | party and interest vetoes |
| Dillon co-belligerent or Atlantic state | fixed Part 2 and canonical Part 4 gate, contribution, home reserve, safeguards, demobilisation | Democracy at War, Allied Co-Belligerent or Atlantic Security State | Protected Dependency or failed mandate |
| Norton parliamentary social state | Labour or coalition mandate, union and rural settlement, neutrality or lawful alignment, services | Parliamentary Social Mandate or Coalition Social Compact | Divided Labour State or extra-parliamentary rupture |
| IRA civil republican state | civil authority, command subordination, administration, recognition, Provision, security and Northern policy | Civil Republican Authority | dual authority, client state, command fragmentation |
| IRA Army Council state | coherent command, district administration, supply, public law or explicit dictatorship | Army Council Command | General Headquarters collapse or foreign client |
| Republican Congress | common programme, plural or one-party constitutional form, armed-wing settlement, economy and Northern labour | Common Programme Authority or Cooperative Commonwealth | fragmented committees or directorate |
| O'Duffy corporate state | successor after death if needed, estate law, army reliability, economy, foreign patron and repression state | Corporate Estate Order | personal dictatorship, oligarchic capture, collapse |
| clerical guardianship | Church and state offices separate or explicit veto state, service, rights, law, foreign reaction | Clerical Guardianship or Producer Settlement | clerical veto, broken services, minority collapse |
| Ailtirí party state | valid wartime emergence, party and administration, mobilisation, repression and exclusion recorded, sponsor outcome | Total Gaelic Vanguard | bureaucratic capture, underground remnant, defeat |
| constitutional High Kingdom | valid crown, Dáil or public law, succession, provinces, minority rights, economy, defence and Northern policy | Crown in Council | empty or captive crown |
| Five Provinces federation | five valid mandates, finance, federal powers, common command, Ulster policy and service delivery | Federal Common Authority | rival sovereignties or painted provinces |
| Otherworld compact and final convergence | valid reveal, human law, sites, obligations, Provision, defence, Northern and foreign settlement. The convergence variant also requires completed crown and provincial component conclusions, stage 5 Northern integration, no foreign patron control and every component obligation valid | Human Stewardship, Compact of Two Irelands, or the Fivefold High Kingdom of Two Irelands convergence variant | supernatural dominion, sterile containment, breach, captive crown, rival province or component separation |

A conclusion is a sequence rather than one reward. It contains an eligibility review, a public or institutional settlement event, foreign reactions where relevant, identity activation, a 180-day consolidation mission, and success, partial, or failure resolution. The route cannot conclude while a required government, law, economy, defence, foreign, Northern, emergency, demobilisation, or identity surface remains unresolved.

The full crown, provincial, and Otherworld convergence is a composite super-conclusion rather than a sixteenth standard conclusion family. It requires the valid component conclusions, stage `5` Northern integration, the final regional review, all material and obligation floors, no patron control, and a separate 180-day composite consolidation. It reuses the component conclusion lifecycles and retains all component failure and cleanup states.

# Exploit and duplication controls

1. A decision that grants equipment, ships, factories, units, claims, influence, or foreign aid records a one-time or escalating-use state.
2. Physical delivery occurs only after the associated mission succeeds.
3. Cancelled projects return no more than 70 percent of recoverable inputs.
4. Units cannot be raised again from the same manpower and equipment pool after disbandment or integration.
5. A sponsor that is defeated, inaccessible, hostile, or no longer sovereign cannot continue deliveries.
6. Claims do not become cores through repeated clicks.
7. Northern core review runs once per region after integration stage 5 and can reopen only after a recorded regression and later recovery.
8. Coalition and support votes expire after the named vote, agreement, election, or breach.
9. Hidden evidence cannot be farmed after a false lead or route closure.
10. Regional-order contributions cannot create free units or equipment. The member pays and the receiving command records ownership.
11. Mission success flags distinguish full and partial success. Partial success cannot claim the full reward through a later cleanup event.
12. Bypasses record the reason and apply only the effects earned by the fulfilled condition.

# Presentation and text direction

Part 5 defines information architecture and tone. It does not provide final player-facing prose.

Decision headers show current values, bottlenecks, active objectives, reserved crisis slots, and the next review. Costs use short icon-first formatting. Complex requirements use a short met or not met summary and a detailed tooltip with named places and current values.

Historical events use institutional, local, civilian, military, labour, family, or diplomatic viewpoints appropriate to the subject. Hidden content reveals uncertainty through records, testimony, site conditions, public behaviour, and consequences. It does not announce secret variables or future routes.
